It is evident that the peripheral transcriptome contains diagnostic and prognostic markers of ILD. With the advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing, increased resolution of transcriptomic profiling will allow for the discovery of cell-specific biomarkers. This chapter covers a preliminary cohort of scRNA-seq samples derived from patients with IPF, HP, and IPAF.

## Methods

### Study population and sample processing

Patients with ILD were prospectively recruited at the Pacific Lung Health Centre (St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada) from 2021-2023. 

- study population table
- sample processing

### Data analysis

- seurat
- cell clustering labeling


## Results

- complete umap with cell annotations
- supp: table featuring top 5-10 cell markers per population?
- forest plot with cell types
- TMEM176B section, MYOM2 section
- relate these two back to RNA-seq data
- 

## Discussion

- tmem176b
- myom2
- comment about historical scRNAseq work, plus the blood scRNAseq, plus what's unique about ours
- comment about progression for our cohort
- comment on what this means in the larger realm of diagnostics, and what's needed for this to work.
