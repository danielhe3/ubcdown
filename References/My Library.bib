	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with a fatal prognosis and manifests in patients over 60 years old who may have comorbidities. The prevalence and impact of comorbidities on the clinical course of IPF is unclear.This systematic literature review examined the prevalence of comorbidities and mortality associated with comorbidities in IPF patients. Relevant observational studies published in English from January 1990 to January 2015 identified via MEDLINE and EMBASE were included; bibliographies of articles were also searched.Among the 126 studies included, prevalence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) was 3-86\%, 6-91\% for obstructive sleep apnoea, 3-48\% for lung cancer and 6-67\% for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Nonrespiratory comorbidities included ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (3-68\%) and gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) (0-94\%). Mortality was highest among patients with IPF and lung cancer. Most studies assessed relatively small samples of patients with IPF.PH, COPD, lung cancer, GER and IHD are significant comorbidities; differences in IPF severity, case definitions and patient characteristics limited the comparability of findings. The identification and prompt treatment of comorbidities may have a clinically significant impact on overall outcome that is meaningful for patients with IPF.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare disease, with estimates of prevalence varying considerably across countries due to paucity in data collection. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and incidence of IPF in Canada using administrative data requiring minimal extrapolation.We used mandatory national administrative data from 2007-2011 to identify IPF cases of all ages with an International Classification of Diseases (Version 10, Canadian) diagnosis code of J84.1. We used a broad definition that excluded cases with subsequent diagnosis of other interstitial lung diseases, and a narrow definition that required further diagnostic testing prior to IPF diagnosis. We explored survival and quality of life.For all ages, the broad prevalence of IPF was 41.8 per 100 000 (14 259 cases) and was higher for men. The incidence rate was 18.7 per 100 000 (6390 cases) and was higher for men. The narrow prevalence was 20.0 per 100 000 (6822 cases) and incidence was 9.0 per 100 000 (3057 cases). The 4-year risk of death was 41.0\% and the quality of life with IPF after 2 years was lower than for Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage IV chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Using comprehensive national data, the prevalence of IPF in Canada was higher than other national estimates, suggesting that either IPF may be more common in Canada or that data capture may have been previously limited.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a form of chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia characterized by progressive worsening of dyspnea and lung function, with a poor prognosis. The objective of this study was to determine treatment patterns, resource use and costs of managing Spanish patients with IPF.
METHODS: A three-round Delphi consensus panel of 15 clinical experts was held between December 2012 and June 2013 using questionnaires to describe the management of patients with IPF. A cost analysis based on Delphi panel estimates was made from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective, including the direct costs of IPF diagnosis and management. Unit costs were applied to Delphi panel estimates of health resource use. Univariate sensitivity analyses were made to evaluate uncertainties in parameters.
RESULTS: The Delphi panel estimated that 20, 60 and 20\% of IPF patients presented with stable disease, slow and rapid disease progression, respectively. The estimated annual cost per patient with stable disease, slow and rapid disease progression was €11,484, €20,978 and €57,759, respectively. This corresponds to a weighted average annual cost of €26,435 with itemized costs of €1,184 (4.5), €7,147 (27.0), €5,950 (22.5), €11,666 (44.1) and €488 (1.9\%) for the diagnosis of IPF, treatment, monitoring, management of acute exacerbations and end-of-life care, respectively. The parameter that varied the annual cost per patient the most was resource use associated with acute exacerbations.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of patients with IPF in Spain, especially patients with rapid disease progression, has a high economic impact on the NHS.},

It represents a collaborative effort between the American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Latin American Thoracic Society.
METHODS: The evidence syntheses were discussed and recommendations formulated by a multidisciplinary committee of IPF experts. The evidence was appraised and recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.
RESULTS: The guideline panel updated the diagnostic criteria for IPF. Previously defined patterns of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) were refined to patterns of UIP, probable UIP, indeterminate, and alternate diagnosis. For patients with newly detected interstitial lung disease (ILD) who have a high-resolution computed tomography scan pattern of probable UIP, indeterminate, or an alternative diagnosis, conditional recommendations were made for performing BAL and surgical lung biopsy; because of lack of evidence, no recommendation was made for or against performing transbronchial lung biopsy or lung cryobiopsy. In contrast, for patients with newly detected ILD who have a high-resolution computed tomography scan pattern of UIP, strong recommendations were made against performing surgical lung biopsy, transbronchial lung biopsy, and lung cryobiopsy, and a conditional recommendation was made against performing BAL. Additional recommendations included a conditional recommendation for multidisciplinary discussion and a strong recommendation against measurement of serum biomarkers for the sole purpose of distinguishing IPF from other ILDs.
CONCLUSIONS: The guideline panel provided recommendations related to the diagnosis of IPF.},

A checklist is provided for the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). The role of CT is expanded to permit diagnosis of IPF without surgical lung biopsy in select cases when CT shows a probable UIP pattern. Additional investigations, including surgical lung biopsy, should be considered in patients with either clinical or CT findings that are indeterminate for IPF. A multidisciplinary approach is particularly important when deciding to perform additional diagnostic assessments, integrating biopsy results with clinical and CT features, and establishing a working diagnosis of IPF if lung tissue is not available. A working diagnosis of IPF should be reviewed at regular intervals since the diagnosis might change. Criteria are presented to establish confident and working diagnoses of IPF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffuse parenchymal lung disease represents a diverse and challenging group of pulmonary disorders. A consistent diagnostic approach to diffuse parenchymal lung disease is crucial if clinical trial data are to be applied to individual patients. We aimed to evaluate inter-multidisciplinary team agreement for the diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung disease.
METHODS: We did a multicentre evaluation of clinical data of patients who presented to the interstitial lung disease unit of the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust (London, UK; host institution) and required multidisciplinary team meeting (MDTM) characterisation between March 1, 2010, and Aug 31, 2010. Only patients whose baseline clinical, radiological, and, if biopsy was taken, pathological data were undertaken at the host institution were included. Seven MDTMs, consisting of at least one clinician, radiologist, and pathologist, from seven countries (Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, and the UK) evaluated cases of diffuse parenchymal lung disease in a two-stage process between Jan 1, and Oct 15, 2015. First, the clinician, radiologist, and pathologist (if lung biopsy was completed) independently evaluated each case, selected up to five differential diagnoses from a choice of diffuse lung diseases, and chose likelihoods (censored at 5\% and summing to 100\% in each case) for each of their differential diagnoses, without inter-disciplinary consultation. Second, these specialists convened at an MDTM and reviewed all data, selected up to five differential diagnoses, and chose diagnosis likelihoods. We compared inter-observer and inter-MDTM agreements on patient first-choice diagnoses using Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ). We then estimated inter-observer and inter-MDTM agreement on the probability of diagnosis using weighted kappa coefficient (κw). We compared inter-observer and inter-MDTM confidence of patient first-choice diagnosis. Finally, we evaluated the prognostic significance of a first-choice diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) versus not IPF for MDTMs, clinicians, and radiologists, using univariate Cox regression analysis.
FINDINGS: 70 patients were included in the final study cohort. Clinicians, radiologists, pathologists, and the MDTMs assigned their patient diagnoses between Jan 1, and Oct 15, 2015. IPF made up 88 (18\%) of all 490 MDTM first-choice diagnoses. Inter-MDTM agreement for first-choice diagnoses overall was moderate (κ=0·50). Inter-MDTM agreement on diagnostic likelihoods was good for IPF (κw=0·71 [IQR 0·64-0·77]) and connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease (κw=0·73 [0·68-0·78]); moderate for non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; κw=0·42 [0·37-0·49]); and fair for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (κw=0·29 [0·24-0·40]). High-confidence diagnoses ({\textgreater}65\% likelihood) of IPF were given in 68 (77\%) of 88 cases by MDTMs, 62 (65\%) of 96 cases by clinicians, and in 57 (66\%) of 86 cases by radiologists. Greater prognostic separation was shown for an MDTM diagnosis of IPF than compared with individual clinician's diagnosis of this disease in five of seven MDTMs, and radiologist's diagnosis of IPF in four of seven MDTMs.
INTERPRETATION: Agreement between MDTMs for diagnosis in diffuse lung disease is acceptable and good for a diagnosis of IPF, as validated by the non-significant greater prognostic separation of an IPF diagnosis made by MDTMs than the separation of a diagnosis made by individual clinicians or radiologists. Furthermore, MDTMs made the diagnosis of IPF with higher confidence and more frequently than did clinicians or radiologists. This difference is of particular importance, because accurate and consistent diagnoses of IPF are needed if clinical outcomes are to be optimised. Inter-multidisciplinary team agreement for a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is low, highlighting an urgent need for standardised diagnostic guidelines for this disease.

Since its publication in July 2015, there has been substantial interest in IPAF. Centers from around the world have published their findings of retrospectively identified cohorts of patients who fulfill IPAF criteria, suggestions for modification of the criteria have been offered, and patients who fulfill IPAF criteria are being included as a subset in the ongoing phase II multicenter unclassifiable ILD treatment trial with pirfenidone. The IPAF designation represents an important first step toward studying and furthering our understanding of the natural history of this cohort of patients with ILD using uniform nomenclature and a standardized set of criteria. Prospective evaluations and, ideally, interdisciplinary and multicenter collaborations will inform best practices for treatment and management and will guide future refinement to the IPAF criteria. This review focuses on the relevant background that led to the development of IPAF, summarizes the proposed criteria, discusses cohort studies of patients with IPAF published to date and what they have taught us about the IPAF phenotype, and offers insights into future directions in this arena.

Being the prototype of interstitial lung diseases, IPF is characterized by marked heterogeneity regarding its clinical course. Despite significant progress in the understanding of its pathogenesis, we still cannot reliably predict the course of the disease and the response to treatment of an individual patient. Non-invasive biomarkers, in particular serum biomarkers, for the (early) diagnosis, differential diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of therapeutic response are urgently needed. Numerous molecules involved in alveolar epithelial cell injury, fibroproliferation and matrix remodeling as well as immune regulation have been proposed as potential biomarkers. Furthermore, genetic variants of TOLLIP, MUC5B, and other genes are associated with a differential response to treatment and with the development and/or the prognosis of IPF. Additionally, the bacterial signature in IPF lungs, as shown from microbiome analyses, as well as mitochondrial DNA seem to have promising roles as biomarkers. Moreover, combination of multiple biomarkers may identify comprehensive biomarker signatures in IPF patients. However, there is still a long way until these potential biomarkers complete or substitute for the clinical and functional parameters currently available for IPF.},

METHODS: MMP-1/7 serum levels were measured using Luminex xMAP technology in 139 patients- 47 IPF, 36 non-IPF Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP), 14 idiopathic Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (iNSIP), 29 secondary NSIP (secNSIP), 13 stage IV sarcoidosis- and 20 healthy controls, and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: MMP-1 was significantly higher in IPF than non-IPF UIP (P = .042) and sarcoidosis (P = .027). MMP-7 was significantly higher in IPF than controls (P {\textless} .001), non-IPF UIP (P = .003), secNSIP (P {\textless} .001), and sarcoidosis (P {\textless} .001). The Area Under the Curve for IPF versus other ILD was 0.63 (95\%CI, 0.53-0.73) for MMP-1, 0.73 (95\%CI, 0.65-0.81) for MMP-7, and 0.74 (95\%CI, 0.66-0.82) for MMP-1/MMP-7 combined. Sensitivity and specificity for MMP-7 cutoff = 3.91 ng/mL was 72.3\% and 66.3\%, respectively, Positive Predictive Values = 52.3\% and Negative Predictive Values = 82.4\%.
CONCLUSIONS: MMP-1 and particularly MMP-7 serum levels were significantly higher in IPF than in non-IPF UIP, the main entity in differential diagnosis. The value of these biomarkers as additional tools in a multidisciplinary approach to IPF diagnosis needs to be considered and further explored.},

Attempts to restore tissue function after damage require knowledge of how physiological tasks are distributed among cell types, and how cell states vary between homeostasis, injury-repair and disease. In the conducting airway, a heterogeneous basal cell population gives rise to specialized luminal cells that perform mucociliary clearance1. Here we perform single-cell profiling of human bronchial epithelial cells and mouse tracheal epithelial cells to obtain a comprehensive census of cell types in the conducting airway and their behaviour in homeostasis and regeneration. Our analysis reveals cell states that represent known and novel cell populations, delineates their heterogeneity and identifies distinct differentiation trajectories during homeostasis and tissue repair. Finally, we identified a novel, rare cell type that we call the 'pulmonary ionocyte', which co-expresses FOXI1, multiple subunits of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) and CFTR, the gene that is mutated in cystic fibrosis. Using immunofluorescence, modulation of signalling pathways and electrophysiology, we show that Notch signalling is necessary and FOXI1 expression is sufficient to drive the production of the pulmonary ionocyte, and that the pulmonary ionocyte is a major source of CFTR activity in the conducting airway epithelium.},

We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify epithelial cell types and associated biological processes involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. Transcriptomic analysis of normal human lung epithelial cells defined gene expression patterns associated with highly differentiated alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, indicated by enrichment of RNAs critical for surfactant homeostasis. In contrast, scRNA-seq of IPF cells identified 3 distinct subsets of epithelial cell types with characteristics of conducting airway basal and goblet cells and an additional atypical transitional cell that contributes to pathological processes in IPF. Individual IPF cells frequently coexpressed alveolar type 1 (AT1), AT2, and conducting airway selective markers, demonstrating "indeterminate" states of differentiation not seen in normal lung development. Pathway analysis predicted aberrant activation of canonical signaling via TGF-β, HIPPO/YAP, P53, WNT, and AKT/PI3K. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy identified the disruption of alveolar structure and loss of the normal proximal-peripheral differentiation of pulmonary epithelial cells. scRNA-seq analyses identified loss of normal epithelial cell identities and unique contributions of epithelial cells to the pathogenesis of IPF.

Analysis of 114,396 cells identified 31 distinct cell subsets/states. We report that a remarkable shift in epithelial cell phenotypes occurs in the peripheral lung in PF and identify several previously unrecognized epithelial cell phenotypes, including a KRT5- /KRT17 + pathologic, ECM-producing epithelial cell population that was highly enriched in PF lungs. Multiple fibroblast subtypes were observed to contribute to ECM expansion in a spatially discrete manner. Together, these data provide high-resolution insights into the complexity and plasticity of the distal lung epithelium in human disease and indicate a diversity of epithelial and mesenchymal cells contribute to pathologic lung fibrosis.},

A novel computational framework for the annotation of scRNA-seq by reference to bulk transcriptomes (SingleR) enabled the subclustering of macrophages and revealed a disease-associated subgroup with a transitional gene expression profile intermediate between monocyte-derived and alveolar macrophages. These CX3CR1+SiglecF+ transitional macrophages localized to the fibrotic niche and had a profibrotic effect in vivo.

	abstract = {Rationale: The contributions of diverse cell populations in the human lung to pulmonary fibrosis pathogenesis are poorly understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal changes within individual cell populations during pulmonary fibrosis that are important for disease pathogenesis. Objectives: To determine whether single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal disease-related heterogeneity within alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, or other cell types in lung tissue from subjects with pulmonary fibrosis compared with control subjects. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on lung tissue obtained from eight transplant donors and eight recipients with pulmonary fibrosis and on one bronchoscopic cryobiospy sample from a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We validated these data using in situ RNA hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and bulk RNA-sequencing on flow-sorted cells from 22 additional subjects. Measurements and Main Results: We identified a distinct, novel population of profibrotic alveolar macrophages exclusively in patients with fibrosis. Within epithelial cells, the expression of genes involved in Wnt secretion and response was restricted to nonoverlapping cells. We identified rare cell populations including airway stem cells and senescent cells emerging during pulmonary fibrosis. We developed a web-based tool to explore these data. Conclusions: We generated a single-cell atlas of pulmonary fibrosis. Using this atlas, we demonstrated heterogeneity within alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells from subjects with pulmonary fibrosis. These results support the feasibility of discovery-based approaches using next-generation sequencing technologies to identify signaling pathways for targeting in the development of personalized therapies for patients with pulmonary fibrosis.},

We show that specific genetic deletion of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages after their recruitment to the lung ameliorated lung fibrosis, whereas tissue-resident alveolar macrophages did not contribute to fibrosis. Using transcriptomic profiling of flow-sorted cells, we found that monocyte to alveolar macrophage differentiation unfolds continuously over the course of fibrosis and its resolution. During the fibrotic phase, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages differ significantly from tissue-resident alveolar macrophages in their expression of profibrotic genes. A population of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages persisted in the lung for one year after the resolution of fibrosis, where they became increasingly similar to tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. Human homologues of profibrotic genes expressed by mouse monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages during fibrosis were up-regulated in human alveolar macrophages from fibrotic compared with normal lungs. Our findings suggest that selectively targeting alveolar macrophage differentiation within the lung may ameliorate fibrosis without the adverse consequences associated with global monocyte or tissue-resident alveolar macrophage depletion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibrocytes are implicated in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) pathogenesis and increased proportions in the circulation are associated with poor prognosis. Upon tissue injury, fibrocytes migrate to the affected organ. In IPF patients, circulating fibrocytes are increased especially during exacerbations, however fibrocytes in the lungs have not been examined. Therefore, we sought to evaluate if fibrocytes can be detected in IPF lungs and we compare percentages and phenotypic characteristics of lung fibrocytes with circulating fibrocytes in IPF.
METHODS: First we optimized flow cytometric detection circulating fibrocytes using a unique combination of intra- and extra-cellular markers to establish a solid gating strategy. Next we analyzed lung fibrocytes in single cell suspensions of explanted IPF and control lungs and compared characteristics and numbers with circulating fibrocytes of IPF.
RESULTS: Using a gating strategy for both circulating and lung fibrocytes, which excludes potentially contaminating cell populations (e.g. neutrophils and different leukocyte subsets), we show that patients with IPF have increased proportions of fibrocytes, not only in the circulation, but also in explanted end-stage IPF lungs. These lung fibrocytes have increased surface expression of HLA-DR, increased intracellular collagen-1 expression, and also altered forward and side scatter characteristics compared with their circulating counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that lung fibrocytes in IPF patients can be quantified and characterized by flow cytometry. Lung fibrocytes have different characteristics than circulating fibrocytes and represent an intermediate cell population between circulating fibrocytes and lung fibroblast. Therefore, more insight in their phenotype might lead to specific therapeutic targeting in fibrotic lung diseases.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Current diagnosis of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (cHP) involves considering a combination of clinical, radiological, and pathological information in multidisciplinary team discussions. However, this approach is highly variable with poor agreement between centers.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify diagnostic criteria for cHP that reach consensus among international experts.
METHODS: A 3-round modified Delphi survey was conducted between April and August 2017. Forty-five experts in interstitial lung disease from 14 countries participated in the online survey. Diagnostic items included in round 1 were generated using expert interviews and literature review. During rounds 1 and 2, experts rated the importance of each diagnostic item on a 5-point Likert scale. The a priori threshold of consensus was ≥ 75\% of experts rating a diagnostic item as very important or important. In the third round, experts graded the items that met consensus as important and provided their level of diagnostic confidence for a series of clinical scenarios.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Consensus was achieved on 18 of the 40 diagnostic items. Among these, experts gave the highest level of importance to the identification of a causative antigen, time relation between exposure and disease, mosaic attenuation on chest imaging, and poorly formed non-necrotizing granulomas on pathology. In clinical scenarios, the diagnostic confidence of experts in cHP was heightened by the presence of these diagnostic items.
CONCLUSION: This consensus-based approach for the diagnosis of cHP represents a first step towards the development of international guidelines for the diagnosis of cHP.},

These questions can be addressed by calculating the probability of sampling at least a defined number of cells from each subpopulation (cell type or cancer clone).
RESULTS: We developed an interactive web application called SCOPIT (Single-Cell One-sided Probability Interactive Tool), which calculates the required probabilities using a multinomial distribution (www.navinlab.com/SCOPIT). In addition, we created an R package called pmultinom for scripting these calculations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our tool for fast multinomial calculations provide a simple and intuitive procedure for prospectively planning single-cell experiments or retrospectively evaluating if sufficient numbers of cells have been sequenced. The web application can be accessed at navinlab.com/SCOPIT.},

Here, we report on a multi-center clinical study in seven FOCIS Centers of Excellence to directly compare TruCulture to conventional PBMC methods. Whole blood and PBMCs from healthy donors were exposed to LPS, anti-CD3 anti-CD28 antibodies, or media alone. 55 protein analytes were analyzed centrally by Luminex multi-analyte profiling in a CLIA-certified laboratory. TruCulture responses showed greater reproducibility and improved the statistical power for monitoring differential immune response activation. The use of TruCulture addresses a major unmet need through a robust and flexible method for immunomonitoring that can be reproducibly applied in multi-center clinical studies.

	abstract = {Background
The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other interstitial lung diseases (ILD) presents significant clinical challenges. To gain insights regarding the diagnostic experience of patients with ILD and to identify potential barriers to a timely and accurate diagnosis, we developed an online questionnaire and conducted a national survey of adults with a self-reported diagnosis of ILD.

Methods
A pre-specified total of 600 subjects were recruited to participate in a 40-question online survey. E-mail invitations containing a link to the survey were sent to 16 427 registered members of the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation. Additionally, an open invitation was posted on an online forum for patients and caregivers (www.inspire.com). The recruitment and screening period was closed once the pre-defined target number of respondents was reached. Eligible participants were adult U.S. residents with a diagnosis of IPF or a non-IPF ILD.

Results
A total of 600 eligible respondents met the eligibility criteria and completed the survey. Of these, 55\% reported ≥ 1 misdiagnosis and 38\% reported ≥ 2 misdiagnoses prior to the current diagnosis. The most common misdiagnoses were asthma (13.5\%), pneumonia (13.0\%), and bronchitis (12.3\%). The median time from symptom onset to current diagnosis was 7 months (range, 0–252 months), with 43\% of respondents reporting a delay of ≥ 1 year and 19\% reporting a delay of ≥ 3 years. Sixty-one percent of respondents underwent at least one invasive diagnostic procedure.

Conclusions
While a minority of patients with ILD will experience an appropriate and expedient diagnosis, the more typical diagnostic experience for individuals with ILD is characterized by considerable delays, frequent misdiagnosis, exposure to costly and invasive diagnostic procedures, and substantial use of healthcare resources. These findings suggest a need for physician education, development of clinical practice recommendations, and improved diagnostic tools aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy in patients with ILD.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been widely used as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The safety and efficacy of this three-drug regimen is unknown.
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who had mild-to-moderate lung-function impairment to one of three groups -- receiving a combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and NAC (combination therapy), NAC alone, or placebo -- in a 1:1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the change in longitudinal measurements of forced vital capacity during a 60-week treatment period.
RESULTS: When approximately 50\% of data had been collected (with 77 patients in the combination-therapy group and 78 in the placebo group), a planned interim analysis revealed that patients in the combination-therapy group, as compared with the placebo group, had an increased rate of death (8 vs. 1, P=0.01) and hospitalization (23 vs. 7, P{\textless}0.001). These observations, coupled with no evidence of physiological or clinical benefit for combination therapy, prompted the independent data and safety monitoring board to recommend termination of the combination-therapy group at a mean follow-up of 32 weeks. Data from the ongoing comparison of the NAC-only group and the placebo group are not reported here.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased risks of death and hospitalization were observed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who were treated with a combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and NAC, as compared with placebo. These findings provide evidence against the use of this combination in such patients.

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease without effective therapeutics. Periostin has been reported to be elevated in IPF patients relative to controls, but its sources and mechanisms of action remain unclear. We confirm excess periostin in lungs of IPF patients and show that IPF fibroblasts produce periostin. Blood was obtained from 54 IPF patients (all but 1 with 48 wk of follow-up). We show that periostin levels predict clinical progression at 48 wk (hazard ratio = 1.47, 95\% confidence interval = 1.03–2.10, P {\textless} 0.05). Monocytes and fibrocytes are sources of periostin in circulation in IPF patients. Previous studies suggest that periostin may regulate the inflammatory phase of bleomycin-induced lung injury, but periostin effects during the fibroproliferative phase of the disease are unknown. Wild-type and periostin-deficient (periostin−/−) mice were anesthetized and challenged with bleomycin. Wild-type mice were injected with bleomycin and then treated with OC-20 Ab (which blocks periostin and integrin interactions) or control Ab during the fibroproliferative phase of disease, and fibrosis and survival were assessed. Periostin expression was upregulated quickly after treatment with bleomycin and remained elevated. Periostin−/− mice were protected from bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Instillation of OC-20 during the fibroproliferative phase improved survival and limited collagen deposition. Chimeric mouse studies suggest that hematopoietic and structural sources of periostin contribute to lung fibrogenesis. Periostin was upregulated by transforming growth factor-β in lung mesenchymal cells, and periostin promoted extracellular matrix deposition, mesenchymal cell proliferation, and wound closure. Thus periostin plays a vital role in late stages of pulmonary fibrosis and is a potential biomarker for disease progression and a target for therapeutic intervention.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in both men and women worldwide. To identify novel factors that contribute to lung cancer pathogenesis, we analyzed a lung cancer database from The Cancer Genome Atlas and found that Krüppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4) expression is significantly lower in patients’ lung cancer tissue than in normal lung tissue. In addition, we identified seven missense mutations in the KLF4 gene. KLF4 is a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation as well as the self-renewal of stem cells. To understand the role of KLF4 in the lung, we generated a tamoxifen-induced Klf4 knockout mouse model. We found that KLF4 inhibits lung cancer cell growth and that depletion of Klf4 altered the differentiation pattern in the developing lung. To understand how KLF4 functions during lung tumorigenesis, we generated the K-rasLSL-G12D/+;Klf4fl/fl mouse model, and we used adenovirus-expressed Cre to induce K-ras activation and Klf4 depletion in the lung. Although Klf4 deletion alone or K-ras mutation alone can trigger lung tumor formation, Klf4 deletion combined with K-ras mutation significantly enhanced lung tumor formation. We also found that Klf4 deletion in conjunction with K-ras activation caused lung inflammation. To understand the mechanism whereby KLF4 is regulated during lung tumorigenesis, we analyzed KLF4 promoter methylation and the profiles of epigenetic factors. We found that Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are overexpressed in lung cancer and that HDAC inhibitors induced expression of KLF4 and inhibited proliferation of lung cancer cells, suggesting that KLF4 is probably repressed by histone acetylation and that HDACs are valuable drug targets for lung cancer treatment.},

Contrasting advanced SSc-ILD to IPF provides insight to the role dysregulated immunity may play in pulmonary fibrosis. To analyze cell-type specific transcriptome commonalities and differences between IPF and SSc-ILD, we compared single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 21 explanted lung tissue specimens from patients with advanced IPF, SSc-ILD, and organ donor controls. Comparison of IPF and SSc-ILD tissue identified divergent patterns of interferon signaling, with interferon-gamma signaling upregulated in the SPP1
hi and FABP4
hi macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, and natural kill cells of IPF, while type I interferon signaling and production was upregulated in the corresponding SSc-ILD populations. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells were found in diseased lungs only, and exhibited upregulated cellular stress pathways in SSc-ILD compared to IPF. Alveolar type I cells were dramatically decreased in both IPF and SSc-ILD, with a distinct transcriptome signature separating these cells by disease. KRT5-/KRT17+ aberrant basaloid cells exhibiting markers of cellular senescence and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were identified in SSc-ILD for the first time. In summary, our study utilizes the enriched capabilities of scRNA-seq to identify key divergent cell types and pathways between IPF and SSc-ILD, providing new insights into the shared and distinct mechanisms between idiopathic and autoimmune interstitial lung diseases.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Disease activity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains highly variable, poorly understood, and difficult to predict. Objectives: To identify a predictor using short-term longitudinal changes in gene expression that forecasts future FVC decline and to characterize involved pathways and cell types. Methods: Seventy-four patients from COMET (Correlating Outcomes with Biochemical Markers to Estimate Time-Progression in IPF) cohort were dichotomized as progressors (≥10\% FVC decline) or stable. Blood gene-expression changes within individuals were calculated between baseline and 4 months and regressed with future FVC status, allowing determination of expression variations, sample size, and statistical power. Pathway analyses were conducted to predict downstream effects and identify new targets. An FVC predictor for progression was constructed in COMET and validated using independent cohorts. Peripheral blood mononuclear single-cell RNA-sequencing data from healthy control subjects were used as references to characterize cell type compositions from bulk peripheral blood mononuclear RNA-sequencing data that were associated with FVC decline. Measurements and Main Results: The longitudinal model reduced gene-expression variations within stable and progressor groups, resulting in increased statistical power when compared with a cross-sectional model. The FVC predictor for progression anticipated patients with future FVC decline with 78\% sensitivity and 86\% specificity across independent IPF cohorts. Pattern recognition receptor pathways and mTOR pathways were downregulated and upregulated, respectively. Cellular deconvolution using single-cell RNA-sequencing data identified natural killer cells as significantly correlated with progression. Conclusions: Serial transcriptomic change predicts future FVC decline. An analysis of cell types involved in the progressor signature supports the novel involvement of natural killer cells in IPF progression.},

Significant differential features were identified by using linear models adjusting for age and sex, inflation, and bias when appropriate. Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker Discovery Using a Latent Component Method for Omics Studies was used for integrative multiomic analysis. We identified 4,643 differentially expressed transcripts aligning to 3,439 genes, 998 differentially abundant proteins, 2,500 differentially methylated regions, and 1,269 differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were significant after correcting for multiple tests (false discovery rate {\textless} 0.05). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using 20 coding mRNA, protein, methylation, and lncRNA features with the highest loadings on the top latent variable from the four data sets demonstrates perfect separation of IPF and control lungs. Our analysis confirmed previously validated molecules and pathways known to be dysregulated in disease and implicated novel molecular features as potential drivers and modifiers of disease. For example, 4 proteins, 18 differentially methylated regions, and 10 lncRNAs were found to have strong correlations ({\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textgreater} 0.8) with MMP7 (matrix metalloproteinase 7). Therefore, by using a system biology approach, we have identified novel molecular relationships in IPF.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the scarring of lung parenchyma resulting in the loss of lung function, remains a fatal disease with a significant unmet medical need. Patients with severe IPF often develop acute exacerbations resulting in the rapid deterioration of lung function, requiring transplantation. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to IPF is key to develop novel therapeutic approaches for end-stage disease., We report here RNA-sequencing analyses of lung tissues from a cohort of patients with transplant-stage IPF (n=36), compared with acute lung injury (ALI) (n=11) and nondisease controls (n=19), that reveal a robust gene expression signature unique to end-stage IPF. In addition to extracellular matrix remodelling pathways, we identified pathways associated with T-cell infiltration/activation, tumour development, and cholesterol homeostasis, as well as novel alternatively spliced transcripts that are differentially regulated in the advanced IPF lung versus ALI or nondisease controls. Additionally, we show a subset of genes that are correlated with percent predicted forced vital capacity and could reflect disease severity., Our results establish a robust transcriptomic fingerprint of an advanced IPF lung that is distinct from previously reported microarray signatures of moderate, stable or progressive IPF and identifies hitherto unknown candidate targets and pathways for therapeutic intervention in late-stage IPF as well as biomarkers to characterise disease progression and enable patient stratification., An RNA-Seq-based transcriptomic fingerprint of severe IPF enriched in pathways of T-cell infiltration/activation, tumour development and cholesterol homeostasis highlights novel splice variants, candidate targets and biomarkers in advanced IPF

However, the mechanism by which IFNg hinders HSC quiescence remains undeﬁned. Using intravital 3-dimensional microscopy, we ﬁnd that IFNg disrupts the normally close interaction between HSCs and CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells in the HSC niche. IFNg stimulation increases expression of the cell surface protein BST2, which we ﬁnd is required for IFNg-dependent HSC relocalization and activation. IFNg stimulation of HSCs increases their E-selectin binding by BST2 and homing to the bone marrow, which depends on E-selectin binding. Upon chronic infection, HSCs from mice lacking BST2 are more quiescent and more resistant to depletion than HSCs from wild-type mice. Overall, this study deﬁnes a critical mechanism by which IFNg promotes niche relocalization and activation in response to inﬂammatory stimulation and identiﬁes BST2 as a key regulator of HSC quiescence.},

	abstract = {About half of all subjects with common variable immune deficiency (CVID) are afflicted with inflammatory complications including hematologic autoimmunity, granulomatous infiltrations, interstitial lung disease, lymphoid hyperplasia and/or gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. The pathogenesis of these conditions is poorly understood but singly and in aggregate, these lead to significantly increased (11 fold) morbidity and mortality, not experienced by CVID subjects without these complications. To explore the dysregulated networks in these subjects, we applied whole blood transcriptional profiling to 91 CVID subjects, 47 with inflammatory conditions and 44 without, in comparison to subjects with XLA and healthy controls. As compared to other CVID subjects, males with XLA or healthy controls, the signature of CVID subjects with inflammatory complications was distinguished by a marked up-regulation of IFN responsive genes. Chronic up-regulation of IFN pathways is known to occur in autoimmune disease due to activation of TLRs and other still unclarified cytoplasmic sensors. As subjects with inflammatory complications were also more likely to be lymphopenic, have reduced B cell numbers, and a greater reduction of B, T and plasma cell networks, we suggest that more impaired adaptive immunity in these subjects may lead to chronic activation of innate IFN pathways in response to environmental antigens. The unbiased use of whole blood transcriptome analysis may provides a tool for distinguishing CVID subjects who are at risk for increased morbidity and earlier mortality. As more effective therapeutic options are developed, whole blood transcriptome analyses could also provide an efficient means of monitoring the effects of treatment of the inflammatory phenotype.},

Emerging novel T cell sub-populations including regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) and interleukin (IL)-17 secreting T helper cells (Th17) may exert antithetical actions in this scenario. Phenotype and frequency of circulating immune cell subsets were assessed by multi-parametric flow cytometry in 29 clinically stable IPF patients and 17 healthy controls. The interplay between Treg lymphocytes expressing transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and Th17 cells was also investigated. Proportion and absolute number of natural killer (NK) cells were significantly reduced in IPF patients in comparison with controls (p{\textless}0.001). Conversely, the proportion and absolute number of CD3+CD4+CD25highFoxp-3+ cells were significantly increased in IPF patients (p=0.000). As in controls, almost the totality of cells ({\textgreater}90\%) expressed TGF-β upon stimulation. Interestingly, the frequency of Th17 cells was significantly compromised in IPF patients (p=0.000) leading to an increased TGF-β/IL-17 ratio (4.2±2.3 vs 0.5±0.3 in controls, p=0.000). Depletion of NK and Th17 cells along with a not compromised Treg compartment delineate the existence of an “immune profile” that argue against the recent hypothesis of IPF as an autoimmune disease. Our findings along with the imbalance of the Treg/Th17 axis more closely suggest these immune perturbations to be similar to those observed in cancer.

Each specimen was assigned a histologic diagnosis, and selected histologic findings were tabulated. Clinical data were abstracted from medical records.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients with clinical diagnoses of chronic HP underwent biopsy of one to three lobes. Ten showed features diagnostic of HP in all specimens. Two had discordant findings that included HP in one specimen and UIP or nonspecific changes in others. Biopsies from two showed only UIP, and one showed NSIP. Diagnostic features were present in all samples from 9 of the 11 patients with more than one biopsy site (81.8\%). Three patients died of disease, including both patients from whom biopsies showed only UIP.
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic HP have supportive histologic findings in surgical lung biopsies. A subset of HP patients has findings indistinguishable from UIP. Sampling from more than one lobe may be helpful in separating HP from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

	abstract = {Background: Chronic bird fancier’s lung (BFL) has often been misdiagnosed as one of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs).
Methods: To define the clinical and pathological characteristics of chronic BFL, 26 patients with chronic BFL from whom a surgical lung biopsy specimen was taken between October 1992 and June 2001 were evaluated. The histopathological characteristics of the surgical lung biopsy specimens were examined and correlations between the histopathology and clinical characteristics were analysed. The quality of chronic inflammatory and fibrotic changes was expressed according to the 2002 ATS/ERS consensus classification of IIPs.
Results: Two patients were diagnosed as having bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia (BOOP)-like lesions, five as having cellular non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)-like lesions, and eight as having fibrotic NSIP-like lesions. The other 11 patients were considered to have usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like lesions because of the temporal heterogeneous appearances of the fibrotic changes. However, fibrosis in these patients had developed in centrilobular as well as perilobular areas, suggestive of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Nineteen patients (73.1\%) had multinucleated giant cells, often with cholesterol clefts, while only five patients (19.2\%) had granulomas. Patients with BOOP-like or cellular NSIP-like lesions tended to have recurrent acute episodes, whereas patients with UIP-like lesions had an insidious onset. Patients with BOOP-like or cellular NSIP-like lesions had a more favourable outcome than those with fibrotic NSIP-like and UIP-like lesions.
Conclusions: The qualities of chronic inflammatory and fibrotic lesions vary significantly among patients with chronic BFL but correlate with clinical features and prognosis.},

	abstract = {Background: This American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Asociación Latinoamericana de Tórax guideline updates prior idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) guidelines and addresses the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) other than IPF.

Methods: A committee was composed of multidisciplinary experts in ILD, methodologists, and patient representatives. 1) Update of IPF: Radiological and histopathological criteria for IPF were updated by consensus. Questions about transbronchial lung cryobiopsy, genomic classifier testing, antacid medication, and antireflux surgery were informed by systematic reviews and answered with evidence-based recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 2) Progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF): PPF was defined, and then radiological and physiological criteria for PPF were determined by consensus. Questions about pirfenidone and nintedanib were informed by systematic reviews and answered with evidence-based recommendations using the GRADE approach.

Results: 1) Update of IPF: A conditional recommendation was made to regard transbronchial lung cryobiopsy as an acceptable alternative to surgical lung biopsy in centers with appropriate expertise. No recommendation was made for or against genomic classifier testing. Conditional recommendations were made against antacid medication and antireflux surgery for the treatment of IPF. 2) PPF: PPF was defined as at least two of three criteria (worsening symptoms, radiological progression, and physiological progression) occurring within the past year with no alternative explanation in a patient with an ILD other than IPF. A conditional recommendation was made for nintedanib, and additional research into pirfenidone was recommended.

Conclusions: The conditional recommendations in this guideline are intended to provide the basis for rational, informed decisions by clinicians.},

Comprehensively dissecting the cellular heterogeneity of FHP paves the way for developing general gene therapeutic solutions for FHP. Here, utilizing an integrated strategy based on scRNA-seq, scTCR-seq, and bulk RNA-seq analysis of FHP profiles, we identified ten major cell types and 19 unique subtypes. FHP exhibited higher features of EMT and inflammation-promoting than normal control. In distinct subsets of lung macrophages in FHP, FN1high, PLA2G7high, and MS4A6Ahigh macrophages with predominant M2 phenotype exhibited higher activity of inflammatory responses and para-inflammation than other macrophages. KRT17high basal-like epithelial cells were significantly increased in FHP, and showed higher ability to induce EMT. We identified roles for ACTA2high, COL1A1high, and PLA2G2Ahigh fibroblasts in FHP, which were significantly related to interstitial fibrosis. NK cells and KLRG1+ effector CD8+ T cells had greater activity in inflammation-promoting. Our results provide a comprehensive portrait of cellular heterogeneity in FHP, and highlight the indispensable role of cell subpopulations in shaping the complexity and heterogeneity of FHP. These subpopulations are potentially key players for FHP pathogenesis.},

Our aim was to analyse NK and NKT-like cell percentages in BAL from 159 patients with different ILD: f-HP, f-NSIP, IPF and CTD-ILD, to evaluate their potential diagnostic/prognostic role. BAL NK cell percentages showed significantly higher values in IPF than in f-HP and f-NSIP, while BAL NKT-like cells showed significantly lower values in the f-NSIP than the f-HP and IPF. A cut-off of 4\%NK cells in BAL of IPF showed a significant difference in survival rate. It suggests a possible new marker of survival and raises the possibility of new targeted approach in treatment and management of IPF.},

Recent studies have identified the key role of crosstalk between dysregulated epithelial cells, mesenchymal, immune, and endothelial cells in IPF. In addition, genetic mutations and environmental factors (e.g., smoking) have also been associated with the development of IPF. With the recent development of sequencing technology, epigenetics, as an intermediate link between gene expression and environmental impacts, has also been reported to be implicated in pulmonary fibrosis. Although the etiology of IPF is unknown, many novel therapeutic targets and agents have emerged from clinical trials for IPF treatment in the past years, and the successful launch of pirfenidone and nintedanib has demonstrated the promising future of anti-IPF therapy. Therefore, we aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathogenic factors of IPF, which would be helpful for the diagnosis of IPF, the development of anti-fibrotic drugs, and improving the prognosis of patients with IPF. In this study, we summarized the pathogenic mechanism, therapeutic targets and clinical trials from the perspective of multiple cell types, gene mutations, epigenetic and environmental factors.},

Obtaining a uniform diagnosis among observers is difficult., Objectives: Evaluate diagnostic agreement between academic and community-based physicians for patients with DPLDs, and determine if an interactive approach between clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists improved diagnostic agreement in community and academic centers., Methods: Retrospective review of 39 patients with DPLD. A total of 19 participants reviewed cases at 2 community locations and 1 academic location. Information from the history, physical examination, pulmonary function testing, high-resolution computed tomography, and surgical lung biopsy was collected. Data were presented in the same sequential fashion to three groups of physicians on separate days., Measurements and Main Results: Each observer's diagnosis was coded into one of eight categories. A κ statistic allowing for multiple raters was used to assess agreement in diagnosis. Interactions between clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists improved interobserver agreement at both community and academic sites; however, final agreement was better within academic centers (κ = 0.55–0.71) than within community centers (κ = 0.32–0.44). Clinically significant disagreement was present between academic and community-based physicians (κ = 0.11–0.56). Community physicians were more likely to assign a final diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis compared with academic physicians., Conclusions: Significant disagreement exists in the diagnosis of DPLD between physicians based in communities compared with those in academic centers. Wherever possible, patients should be referred to centers with expertise in diffuse parenchymal lung disorders to help clarify the diagnosis and provide suggestions regarding treatment options.},

CXCR3 is expressed on activated immune cells and proliferating endothelial cells. The role of CXCR3 in fibroproliferation has not been investigated. We examined the role of CXCR3 in pulmonary injury and repair in vivo. CXCR3-deficient mice demonstrated increased mortality with progressive interstitial fibrosis relative to WT mice. Increased fibrosis occurred without increased inflammatory cell recruitment. CXCR3 deficiency resulted in both a reduced early burst of IFN-γ production and decreased expression of CXCL10 after lung injury. We identified a relative deficiency in lung NK cells in the unchallenged CXCR3-deficient lung and demonstrated production of IFN-γ by WT lung NK cells in vivo following lung injury. The fibrotic phenotype in the CXCR3-deficient mice was significantly reversed following administration of exogenous IFN-γ or restoration of endogenous IFN-γ production by adoptive transfer of WT lymph node and spleen cells. Finally, pretreatment of WT mice with IFN-γ–neutralizing Ab’s enhanced fibrosis following lung injury. These data demonstrate a nonredundant role for CXCR3 in limiting tissue fibroproliferation and suggest that this effect may be mediated, in part, by the innate production of IFN-γ following lung injury.},

In this study, we analysed circulating and lung resident monocyte populations, and assessed their phenotype and recruitment from the blood to the lung in ILD. Flow cytometry analysis of blood samples for quantifying circulating monocytes was performed in 105 subjects: 83 with ILD (n=36, n=28 and n=19 for nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and connective-tissue disease-associated ILD, respectively), as well as 22 controls. Monocyte localisation and abundance were assessed using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry of lung tissue. Monocyte populations were cultured either alone or with endothelial cells to assess fractalkine-dependent transmigration pattern. We show that circulating classical monocytes (CM) were increased in ILD compared with controls, while nonclassical monocytes (NCM) were decreased. CM abundance correlated inversely with lung function, while NCM abundance correlated positively. Both CCL2 and CX3CL1 concentrations were increased in plasma and lungs of ILD patients. Fractalkine co-localised with ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, thereby creating a chemoattractant gradient towards the lung. Fractalkine enhanced endothelial transmigration of NCM in ILD samples only. Immunofluorescence, as well as flow cytometry, showed an increased presence of NCM in fibrotic niches in ILD lungs. Moreover, NCM in the ILD lungs expressed increased CX3CR1, M2-like and phagocytic markers. Taken together, our data support that in ILD, fractalkine drives the migration of CX3CR1+ NCM to the lungs, thereby perpetuating the local fibrotic process.},

	abstract = {The bleomycin-induced rodent lung fibrosis model is commonly used to study mechanisms of lung fibrosis and to test potential therapeutic interventions, despite the well recognized dissimilarities to human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Therefore, in this study, we sought to identify genomic commonalities between the gene expression profiles from 100 IPF lungs and 108 control lungs that were obtained from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium, and rat lungs harvested at Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56 after bleomycin instillation. Surprisingly, the highest gene expression similarity between bleomycin-treated rat and IPF lungs was observed at Day 7. At this point of maximal rat-human commonality, we identified a novel set of 12 disease-relevant translational gene markers (C6, CTHRC1, CTSE, FHL2, GAL, GREM1, LCN2, MMP7, NELL1, PCSK1, PLA2G2A, and SLC2A5) that was able to separate almost all patients with IPF from control subjects in our cohort and in two additional IPF/control cohorts (GSE10667 and GSE24206). Furthermore, in combination with diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide measurements, four members of the translational gene marker set contributed to stratify patients with IPF according to disease severity. Significantly, pirfenidone attenuated the expression change of one (CTHRC1) translational gene marker in the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model, in transforming growth factor-β1-treated primary human lung fibroblasts and transforming growth factor-β1-treated human epithelial A549 cells. Our results suggest that a strategy focused on rodent model-human disease commonalities may identify genes that could be used to predict the pharmacological impact of therapeutic interventions, and thus facilitate the development of novel treatments for this devastating lung disease.},

	abstract = {Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical for the maintenance of cellular
homeostasis during stress responses, but its role in lung fibrosis is unknown.
Here, we found that the activity and expression of iodothyronine deiodinase 2
(DIO2), an enzyme that activates TH, was higher in lungs of patients with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis compared to control individuals and correlated
with disease severity. We also found that Dio2 knockout mice
exhibited enhanced bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Aerosolized TH delivery
increased survival and resolved fibrosis in two models of pulmonary fibrosis in
mice (intratracheal bleomycin and inducible TGF-β1). Sobetirome, a TH
mimetic, also blunted bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Given after
bleomycin-induced injury, TH promoted mitochondrial biogenesis, improved
mitochondrial bioenergetics and attenuated mitochondria-regulated apoptosis in
alveolar epithelial cells both in vivo and in
vitro. TH did not blunt fibrosis in Ppargc1a or
Pink1 knockout mice suggesting dependence on these
pathways. We conclude that the TH anti-fibrotic properties are associated with
protection of alveolar epithelial cells and restoration of mitochondrial
function and thus may represent an effective therapy for pulmonary fibrosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proposed criteria for progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD) have been linked to increased mortality risk, but lung function trajectory after satisfying individual criteria remains unknown. Because survival is rarely employed as the primary end-point in therapeutic trials, identifying PF-ILD criteria that best predict subsequent change in forced vital capacity (FVC) could improve clinical trial design.
METHODS: A retrospective, multicentre longitudinal cohort analysis was performed in consecutive patients with fibrotic connective tissue disease-associated ILD (CTD-ILD), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia at three US centres (test cohort) and one UK centre (validation cohort). 1-year change in FVC after satisfying proposed PF-ILD criteria was estimated using joint modelling. Subgroup analyses were performed to determine whether results varied across key subgroups.
RESULTS: 1227 patients were included, with CTD-ILD predominating. Six out of nine PF-ILD criteria were associated with differential 1-year change in FVC, with radiological progression of fibrosis, alone and in combination with other features, associated with the largest subsequent decline in FVC. Findings varied significantly by ILD subtype, with CTD-ILD demonstrating little change in FVC after satisfying most PF-ILD criteria, while other ILDs showed significantly larger changes. Findings did not vary after stratification by radiological pattern or exposure to immunosuppressant therapy. Near-term change in FVC after satisfying proposed PF-ILD criteria was heterogeneous depending on the criterion assessed and was strongly influenced by ILD subtype.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings may inform future clinical trial design and suggest ILD subtype should be taken into consideration when applying PF-ILD criteria.},

Genome-wide association studies have reported signals of association implicating multiple pathways including host defense, telomere maintenance, signaling, and cell–cell adhesion., Objectives: To improve our understanding of factors that increase IPF susceptibility by identifying previously unreported genetic associations., Methods: We conducted genome-wide analyses across three independent studies and meta-analyzed these results to generate the largest genome-wide association study of IPF to date (2,668 IPF cases and 8,591 controls). We performed replication in two independent studies (1,456 IPF cases and 11,874 controls) and functional analyses (including statistical fine-mapping, investigations into gene expression, and testing for enrichment of IPF susceptibility signals in regulatory regions) to determine putatively causal genes. Polygenic risk scores were used to assess the collective effect of variants not reported as associated with IPF., Measurements and Main Results: We identified and replicated three new genome-wide significant (P {\textless} 5 × 10−8) signals of association with IPF susceptibility (associated with altered gene expression of KIF15, MAD1L1, and DEPTOR) and confirmed associations at 11 previously reported loci. Polygenic risk score analyses showed that the combined effect of many thousands of as yet unreported IPF susceptibility variants contribute to IPF susceptibility., Conclusions: The observation that decreased DEPTOR expression associates with increased susceptibility to IPF supports recent studies demonstrating the importance of mTOR signaling in lung fibrosis. New signals of association implicating KIF15 and MAD1L1 suggest a possible role of mitotic spindle-assembly genes in IPF susceptibility.},

However, their functional significance in lung fibrosis remains unknown. In this study, we used a model of lung pericyte-like cell ablation to test the hypothesis that pericyte-like cell ablation attenuates lung fibrosis in bleomycin-induced lung injury. Lung fibrosis was induced by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. To ablate pericyte-like cells in the lung, diphtheria toxin (DT) was administered to Foxd1-Cre;Rosa26-iDTR mice at two different phases of bleomycin-induced lung injury. For early ablation, we coadministered bleomycin with DT and harvested mice at days 7 and 21. To test the effect of ablation after acute injury, we delivered DT 7 days after bleomycin administration. We assessed fibrosis by lung hydroxyproline content and semiquantitative analysis of picrosirius red staining. We performed bronchoalveolar lavage to determine cell count and differential. We also interrogated mRNA expression of fibrosis-related genes in whole lung RNA. Compared with DT-insensitive littermates where pericyte-like cells were not ablated, DT-sensitive animals exhibited no difference in fibrosis at day 21 both in the early and late pericyte ablation models. However, early ablation of pericytes reduced acute lung inflammation, as indicated by decreased inflammatory cells. Our data confirm a role for pericytes in regulating pulmonary inflammation in early lung injury.},

Here, we conducted a single-cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize postnatal AT1 cell development and identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (Igfbp2) as a genetic marker specifically expressed in postnatal AT1 cells. The portion of AT1 cells expressing Igfbp2 increases during alveologenesis and in post pneumonectomy (PNX) newly formed alveoli. We found that the adult AT1 cell population contains both Hopx+Igfbp2+ and Hopx+Igfbp2− AT1 cells, which have distinct cell fates during alveolar regeneration. Using an Igfbp2-CreER mouse model, we demonstrate that Hopx+Igfbp2+ AT1 cells represent terminally differentiated AT1 cells that are not able to transdifferentiate into AT2 cells during post-PNX alveolar regeneration.

To date, the therapeutic options for patients with pulmonary fibrosis are limited, and organ transplantation remains the most effective option. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5) is a conserved member of the IGFBP family of proteins that is overexpressed in SSc and IPF. In this study, we demonstrate that both exogenous and adenovirally expressed IGFBP-5 promote fibrosis by increasing the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and the expression of pro-fibrotic genes in primary human lung fibroblasts. IGFBP-5 increased expression of the pro-fibrotic growth factor CTGF and levels of the matrix crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX). Silencing of IGFBP-5 had different effects in lung fibroblasts from normal donors and patients with SSc or IPF. Moreover, we show that IGFBP-5 increases expression of ECM genes, CTGF, and LOX in human lung tissues maintained in organ culture. Together, our data extend our previous findings and demonstrate that IGFBP-5 exerts its pro-fibrotic activity by directly inducing expression of ECM and pro-fibrotic genes. Further, IGFBP-5 promotes its own expression, generating a positive feedback loop. This suggests that IGFBP-5 likely acts in concert with other growth factors to drive fibrosis and tissue remodeling.},

	abstract = {In the distal lung, alveolar epithelial type I cells (AT1s) comprise the vast majority of alveolar surface area and are uniquely flattened to allow the diffusion of oxygen into the capillaries. This structure along with a quiescent, terminally differentiated phenotype has made AT1s particularly challenging to isolate or maintain in cell culture. As a result, there is a lack of established models for the study of human AT1 biology, and in contrast to alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2s), little is known about the mechanisms regulating their differentiation. Here we engineer a human in vitro AT1 model system through the directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). We first define the global transcriptomes of primary adult human AT1s, suggesting gene-set benchmarks and pathways, such as Hippo-LATS-YAP/TAZ signaling, that are enriched in these cells. Next, we generate iPSC-derived AT2s (iAT2s) and find that activating nuclear YAP signaling is sufficient to promote a broad transcriptomic shift from AT2 to AT1 gene programs. The resulting cells express a molecular, morphologic, and functional phenotype reminiscent of human AT1 cells, including the capacity to form a flat epithelial barrier which produces characteristic extracellular matrix molecules and secreted ligands. Our results indicate a role for Hippo-LATS-YAP signaling in the differentiation of human AT1s and demonstrate the generation of viable AT1-like cells from iAT2s, providing an in vitro model of human alveolar epithelial differentiation and a potential source of human AT1s that until now have been challenging to viably obtain from patients.},

Here, using droplet- and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing of approximately 75,000 human cells across all lung tissue compartments and circulating blood, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, we create an extensive cell atlas of the human lung. We define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 out of 45 previously known cell types and 14 previously unknown ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas identifies the biochemical functions of lung cells and the transcription factors and markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signalling interactions and immune cell homing; and identifies cell types that are directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. By comparing human and mouse data, we identified 17 molecular cell types that have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others with substantially altered expression profiles, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types. This atlas provides the molecular foundation for investigating how lung cell identities, functions and interactions are achieved in development and tissue engineering and altered in disease and evolution.},

Here, we generated and integrated single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic data from multiple large pulmonary fibrosis patient cohorts. Integration of 233,638 single-cell transcriptomes (n = 61) across three independent cohorts enabled us to derive shifts in cell type proportions and a robust core set of genes altered in lung fibrosis for 45 cell types. Mass spectrometry analysis of lung lavage fluid (n = 124) and plasma (n = 141) proteomes identified distinct protein signatures correlated with diagnosis, lung function, and injury status. A novel SSTR2+ pericyte state correlated with disease severity and was reflected in lavage fluid by increased levels of the complement regulatory factor CFHR1. We further discovered CRTAC1 as a biomarker of alveolar type-2 epithelial cell health status in lavage fluid and plasma. Using cross-modal analysis and machine learning, we identified the cellular source of biomarkers and demonstrated that information transfer between modalities correctly predicts disease status, suggesting feasibility of clinical cell state monitoring through longitudinal sampling of body fluid proteomes.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a devastating disease characterized by progressive elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular failure, and ultimately death. We have shown previously that insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), a molecule highly critical to insulin resistance and metabolism, has an anti-inflammatory role in Th2-skewed lung inflammation and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that IRS2 has an immunomodulatory role in human and experimental PH. Expression analysis showed that IRS2 was significantly decreased in the pulmonary vasculature of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and in rat models of PH. In mice, genetic ablation of IRS2 enhanced the hypoxia-induced signaling pathway of Akt and Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) in the lung tissue and increased pulmonary vascular muscularization, proliferation, and perivascular macrophage recruitment. Furthermore, mice with homozygous IRS2 gene deletion showed a significant gene dosage-dependent increase in pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy in response to hypoxia. Functional studies with bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from homozygous IRS2 gene-deleted mice showed that hypoxia exposure led to enhancement of the Akt and ERK signaling pathway followed by increases in the pro-PH macrophage activation markers, vascular endothelial growth factor-A and arginase 1. Our data suggest that IRS2 contributes to anti-inflammatory effects by regulating macrophage activation and recruitment, which may limit the vascular inflammation, remodeling, and right ventricular hypertrophy that are seen in PH pathology. Restoring the IRS2 pathway may be an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of PH and right heart failure.},

	abstract = {Background:

Cellular diversity of the lung endothelium has not been systematically characterized in humans. We provide a reference atlas of human lung endothelial cells (ECs) to facilitate a better understanding of the phenotypic diversity and composition of cells comprising the lung endothelium.

Methods:

We reprocessed human control single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from 6 datasets. EC populations were characterized through iterative clustering with subsequent differential expression analysis. Marker genes were validated by fluorescent microscopy and in situ hybridization. scRNAseq of primary lung ECs cultured in vitro was performed. The signaling network between different lung cell types was studied. For cross-species analysis or disease relevance, we applied the same methods to scRNAseq data obtained from mouse lungs or from human lungs with pulmonary hypertension.

Results:

Six lung scRNAseq datasets were reanalyzed and annotated to identify {\textgreater}15 000 vascular EC cells from 73 individuals. Differential expression analysis of EC revealed signatures corresponding to endothelial lineage, including panendothelial, panvascular, and subpopulation-specific marker gene sets. Beyond the broad cellular categories of lymphatic, capillary, arterial, and venous ECs, we found previously indistinguishable subpopulations; among venous EC, we identified 2 previously indistinguishable populations: pulmonary–venous ECs (COL15A1neg) localized to the lung parenchyma and systemic–venous ECs (COL15A1pos) localized to the airways and the visceral pleura; among capillary ECs, we confirmed their subclassification into recently discovered aerocytes characterized by EDNRB, SOSTDC1, and TBX2 and general capillary EC. We confirmed that all 6 endothelial cell types, including the systemic–venous ECs and aerocytes, are present in mice and identified endothelial marker genes conserved in humans and mice. Ligand-receptor connectome analysis revealed important homeostatic crosstalk of EC with other lung resident cell types. scRNAseq of commercially available primary lung ECs demonstrated a loss of their native lung phenotype in culture. scRNAseq revealed that endothelial diversity is maintained in pulmonary hypertension. Our article is accompanied by an online data mining tool (www.LungEndothelialCellAtlas.com).

Conclusions:

Our integrated analysis provides a comprehensive and well-crafted reference atlas of ECs in the normal lung and confirms and describes in detail previously unrecognized endothelial populations across a large number of humans and mice.},

	abstract = {Rationale Contribution of central lung tissues to pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains unknown.
Objective To ascertain the relationship between cell types of IPF-central and IPF-peripheral lung explants using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptome.
Methods Biopsies of paired IPF-central and IPF-peripheral along with non-IPF lungs were selected by reviewing H\&E data. Criteria for differentially expressed genes (DEG) were set at false discovery rate {\textless}5\% and fold change {\textgreater}2. Computational cell composition deconvolution was performed. Signature scores were computed for each cell type.
Findings Comparison of central IPF versus non-IPF identified 1723 DEG (1522 upregulated and 201 downregulated). Sixty-two per cent (938/1522) of the mutually upregulated genes in central IPF genes were also upregulated in peripheral IPF versus non-IPF. Moreover, 85 IPF central-associated genes (CAG) were upregulated in central IPF versus both peripheral IPF and central non-IPF. IPF single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed the highest CAG signature score in myofibroblasts and significantly correlated with a previously published activated fibroblasts signature (r=0.88, p=1.6×10−4). CAG signature scores were significantly higher in IPF than in non-IPF myofibroblasts (p=0.013). Network analysis of central-IPF genes identified a module significantly correlated with the deconvoluted proportion of myofibroblasts in central IPF and anti-correlated with inflammation foci trait in peripheral IPF. The module genes were over-represented in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis signalling pathways.
Interpretation Gene expression in central IPF lung regions demonstrates active myofibroblast features that contributes to disease progression. Further elucidation of pathological transcriptomic state of cells in the central regions of the IPF lung that are relatively spared from morphological rearrangements may provide insights into molecular changes in the IPF progression.},

We describe an analysis connecting single cell gene expression with bulk gene expression-based subsetting of patient cohorts to identify IPF patient subsets with different underlying pathogenesis and cellular changes. We reproduced earlier findings indicating the existence of two major subsets in IPF and showed that these subsets display different alterations in cellular composition of the lung. We developed classifiers based on the cellular changes in disease to distinguish subsets. Specifically, we showed that one subset of IPF patients had significant increases in gene signature scores for myeloid cells versus a second subset that had significantly increased gene signature scores for ciliated epithelial cells, suggesting a differential pathogenesis among IPF subsets. Ligand-receptor analyses suggested there was a monocyte-macrophage chemoattractant axis (including potentially CCL2-CCR2 and CCL17-CCR4) among the myeloid-enriched IPF subset and a ciliated epithelium-derived chemokine axis (e.g. CCL15) among the ciliated epithelium-enriched IPF subset. We also found that these IPF subsets had differential expression of pirfenidone-responsive genes suggesting that our findings may provide an approach to identify patients with differential responses to pirfenidone and other drugs. We believe this work is an important step towards targeted therapies and biomarkers of response.},

Identifying these endotypes would improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF and could allow for a biomarker-­ driven personalised medicine approach. We aimed to identify clinically distinct groups of patients with IPF that could represent distinct disease endotypes. Methods  We co-­normalised, pooled and clustered three publicly available blood transcriptomic datasets (total 220 IPF cases). We compared clinical traits across clusters and used gene enrichment analysis to identify biological pathways and processes that were over-­ represented among the genes that were differentially expressed across clusters. A gene-­based classifier was developed and validated using three additional independent datasets (total 194 IPF cases). Findings  We identified three clusters of patients with IPF with statistically significant differences in lung function (p=0.009) and mortality (p=0.009) between groups. Gene enrichment analysis implicated mitochondrial homeostasis, apoptosis, cell cycle and innate and adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis underlying these groups. We developed and validated a 13-­gene cluster classifier that predicted mortality in IPF (high-­risk clusters vs low-­risk cluster: HR 4.25, 95\% CI 2.14 to 8.46, p=3.7×10−5). Interpretation  We have identified blood gene expression signatures capable of discerning groups of patients with IPF with significant differences in survival. These clusters could be representative of distinct pathophysiological states, which would support the theory of multiple endotypes of IPF. Although more work must be done to confirm the existence of these endotypes, our classifier could be a useful tool in patient stratification and outcome prediction in IPF.},

Samples were profiled by quantitative label-free mass spectrometry, Western blotting, or confocal imaging., Measurements and Main Results: We determined the abundance of more than 7,900 proteins and stratified these proteins according to their detergent solubility profiles. Common protein regulations across all ILD cases, as well as distinct ILD subsets, were observed. Proteomic comparison of lung and skin fibrosis identified a common upregulation of marginal zone B- and B1-cell–specific protein (MZB1), the expression of which identified MZB1+/CD38+/CD138+/CD27+/CD45−/CD20− plasma B cells in fibrotic lung and skin tissue. MZB1 levels correlated positively with tissue IgG and negatively with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide., Conclusions: Despite the presumably high molecular and cellular heterogeneity of ILD, common protein regulations are observed, even across organ boundaries. The surprisingly high prevalence of MZB1-positive plasma B cells in tissue fibrosis warrants future investigations regarding the causative role of antibody-mediated autoimmunity in idiopathic cases of organ fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

Kyn, the main product of Trp metabolism pathway catalyzed by TDO2 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in tumor cells, was also demonstrated to activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which may regulate cancer growth and invasion in some malignancies. However, whether TDO2 participates in the metastasis and invasion of HCC has not been explored before. The underlying mechanism played by TDO2 in this process still requires further investigation. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of TDO2 correlates with advanced stage or malignant traits in HCC patients. Knockdown or inhibition of TDO2 suppressed the migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential program happened in the initial phase of cancer metastasis. We found that in HCC cells, TDO2 promoted the EMT process evidenced by altered levels of biomarkers for EMT. Mechanically, TDO2 regulated the Kyn production in HCC cell via activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Together, these results indicate that TDO2 promotes the EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma through activating Kyn-AhR pathway, thereby participating in the metastasis and invasion of HCC.},

SPP1hi macrophages in fibrotic lower lobes showed highly upregulated SPP1 and MERTK expression. Low-level local proliferation of SPP1hi macrophages in normal lungs was strikingly increased in IPF lungs.Co-localisation and causal modelling supported the role for these highly proliferative SPP1hi macrophages in activation of IPF myofibroblasts in lung fibrosis. These data suggest that SPP1hi macrophages contribute importantly to lung fibrosis in IPF, and that therapeutic strategies targeting MERTK and macrophage proliferation may show promise for treatment of this disease.},

	abstract = {Background
Although fatty acid metabolism has been confirmed to be involved in the pathological process of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), systematic analyses on the immune process mediated by fatty acid metabolism-related genes (FAMRGs) in IPF remain lacking.

Methods
The gene expression data of 315 patients with IPF were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database and were divided into the training and verification sets. The core FAMRGs of the training set were identified through weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Then, the fatty acid metabolism-related subtypes in IPF were identified on the basis of k-means unsupervised clustering. The scores of fatty acid metabolism and the expression of the fibrosis biomarkers in different subtypes were compared, and functional enrichment analysis was carried out on the differentially expressed genes between subtypes. A random forest model was used to select important FAMRGs as diagnostic markers for distinguishing between subtypes, and a line chart model was constructed and verified by using other datasets and rat models with different degrees of pulmonary fibrosis. The difference in immune cell infiltration among subtypes was evaluated with CIBERSORT, and the correlation between core diagnostic markers and immune cells were analyzed.

Results
Twenty-four core FAMRGs were differentially expressed between the training set and normal samples, and IPF was divided into two subtypes. Significant differences were observed between the two subtypes in biological processes, such as linoleic acid metabolism, cilium movement, and natural killer (NK) cell activation. The subtype with high fatty acid metabolism had more severe pulmonary fibrosis than the other subtype. A reliable construction line chart model based on six diagnostic markers was constructed, and ABCA3 and CYP24A1 were identified as core diagnostic markers. Significant differences in immune cell infiltration were found between the two subtypes, and ABCA3 and CYP24A1 were closely related to NK cells.

Conclusion
Fatty acid metabolism and the immune process that it mediates play an important role in the occurrence and development of IPF. The analysis of the role of FAMRGs in IPF may provide a new potential therapeutic target for IPF.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive fibrotic lung disease with high mortality and morbidity. ASPN (asporin), a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family, plays crucial roles in tissue injury and regeneration. However, the precise pathophysiological role of ASPN and its molecular mechanisms in IPF remain unknown. We sought to investigate the role of ASPN during the development of pulmonary fibrosis and the therapeutic potential of targeting ASPN-related signaling pathways. In our study, three microarray datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and differentially expressed genes were screened out by bioinformatic analysis. Hub genes were selected from the protein–protein interaction network. ASPN was examined in lung tissues from pulmonary fibrosis mouse models, and the role of ASPN in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad signaling was determined by transfection with ASPN shRNA vectors in vitro. Biotinylation assays were conducted to measure plasma membrane TFG-β receptor I (TβRI) and TβRI recycling after ASPN knockdown. The results showed ASPN expression was increased in the lungs of pulmonary fibrosis mouse models, and ASPN was primarily localized in α-SMA+ myofibroblasts. In vitro experiments proved that ASPN knockdown inhibited TGF-β/Smad signaling and myofibroblast differentiation by regulating the stability of TβRI. Further molecular mechanisms revealed that ASPN knockdown inhibited TGF-β/Smad signaling by suppressing recycling of TβRI to the cell surface in a Rab11-dependent manner and facilitated lysosome-mediated degradation of TβRI. In conclusion, our findings provide important evidence for the use of ASPN as a novel pharmacological target for treating pulmonary fibrosis.},

	abstract = {In Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), there is unrelenting scarring of the lung mediated by pathological mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) that manifest autonomous fibrogenicity in xenograft models. To determine where along their differentiation trajectory IPF MPCs acquire fibrogenic properties, we analyzed the transcriptome of 335 MPCs isolated from the lungs of 3 control and 3 IPF patients at the single-cell level. Using transcriptional entropy as a metric for differentiated state, we found that the least differentiated IPF MPCs displayed the largest differences in their transcriptional profile compared to control MPCs. To validate entropy as a surrogate for differentiated state functionally, we identified increased CD44 as a characteristic of the most entropic IPF MPCs. Using FACS to stratify IPF MPCs based on CD44 expression, we determined that CD44hi IPF MPCs manifested an increased capacity for anchorage-independent colony formation compared to CD44lo IPF MPCs. To validate our analysis morphologically, we used two differentially expressed genes distinguishing IPF MPCs from control (CD44, cell surface; and MARCKS, intracellular). In IPF lung tissue, pathological MPCs resided in the highly cellular perimeter region of the fibroblastic focus. Our data support the concept that IPF fibroblasts acquire a cell-autonomous pathological phenotype early in their differentiation trajectory.},

To address this, the current study (1) documents the upregulation of IGF-1 via TGFβ in myofibroblasts and fibrotic lung tissue, as well as its correlation with decreased pulmonary function in advanced IPF; (2) identifies IGF-1's C1 promoter as mediating the increase in IGF-1 transcription by TGFβ in pulmonary fibroblasts; (3) determines that SMAD2 and mTOR signaling are required for TGFβ-dependent Igf-1 expression in myofibroblasts; (4) demonstrates IGF-1R activation is essential to support TGFβ-driven profibrotic myofibroblast functions and excessive wound healing; and (5) establishes the effectiveness of slowing the progression of murine lung fibrosis with the IGF-1R inhibitor OSI-906.

The IPF lung is characterized by abnormal lung remodeling, epithelial cell hyperplasia, myofibroblast foci formation, and extracellular matrix deposition. Analysis of gene expression microarray data revealed that cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein is among the most significantly up-regulated genes (Fold change 13, p-value {\textless}0.05) in IPF lungs. This finding was confirmed at the mRNA level by nCounter® expression analysis in additional 115 IPF lungs and 154 control lungs as well as at the protein level by western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that COMP was expressed in dense fibrotic regions of IPF lungs and co-localized with vimentin and around pSMAD3 expressing cells. Stimulation of normal human lung fibroblasts with TGF-β1 induced an increase in COMP mRNA and protein expression. Silencing COMP in normal human lung fibroblasts significantly inhibited cell proliferation and negatively impacted the effects of TGF-β1 on COL1A1 and PAI1. COMP protein concentration measured by ELISA assay was significantly increased in serum of IPF patients compared to controls. Analysis of serum COMP concentrations in 23 patients who had prospective blood draws revealed that COMP levels increased in a time dependent fashion and correlated with declines in force vital capacity (FVC). Taken together, our results should encourage more research into the potential use of COMP as a biomarker for disease activity and TGF-β1 activity in patients with IPF. Hence, studies that explore modalities that affect COMP expression, alleviate extracellular matrix rigidity and lung restriction in IPF and interfere with the amplification of TGF-β1 signaling should be persuaded.},

FHL2 (four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 2) is a scaffolding protein that interacts with numerous cellular proteins, regulating signalling cascades and gene transcription. It is involved in tissue remodelling and tumour progression. Recent data suggest that FHL2 might support fibrogenesis by maintaining the transcriptional expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and the excessive synthesis and assembly of matrix proteins in activated fibroblasts. Here, we present evidence that FHL2 does not promote bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, but rather suppresses this process by attenuating lung inflammation. Loss of FHL2 results in increased expression of the pro-inflammatory matrix protein tenascin C and downregulation of the macrophage activating C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN. Consequently, FHL2 knockout mice developed a severe and long-lasting lung pathology following bleomycin administration due to enhanced expression of tenascin C and impaired activation of inflammation-resolving macrophages.},

	abstract = {Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 plays an important role in the
 development of pulmonary fibrosis. In this study we examined the relationship
 between TGF-β1 stimulation and the expression of heparan sulfate (HS)
 6-O-endosulfatase 1 (Sulf1) in cultured normal human lung fibroblasts
 (NHLFs) and in murine lungs in vivo. By removing
 6-O-sulfates from specific HS intrachain sites on the cell surface,
 Sulf1 has been shown to modulate the activities of many HS binding growth
 factors and morphogens including fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. Real time
 reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that TGF-β1 increased Sulf1
 expression in NHLFs in a dose- and time-dependent manner which was accompanied
 by a decrease in 6-O-sulfated disaccharides as revealed by high
 performance liquid chromatography analysis. Decreased ERK activation after
 FGF-2 stimulation was observed in TGF-β1-treated NHLFs compared with
 control cells without changes in HS-dependent FGF-2 binding or
 FGF-2·FR1c complex formation. To study the function of Sulf1, negative
 control or Sulf1-specific small interference RNA (siRNA)-transfected NHLFs
 were stimulated with TGF-β1. Enhanced Smad2/3 phosphorylation and
 elevated total Smad2 protein level were observed in Sulf1 siRNA-transfected
 cells and were accompanied by enhanced expression of α-smooth muscle
 actin and fibronectin. In addition, Sulf1 siRNA transfection enhanced the
 anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β1. Finally Sulf1 expression was
 up-regulated in the lungs of mice treated with adenovirus encoding active
 TGF-β1. Taken together, our data indicate that Sulf1 is a
 TGF-β1-responsive gene both in vitro and in vivo and
 may function as a negative regulator of TGF-β1-induced fibrogenesis.},

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that lead to end-stage human pulmonary fibrosis we analyzed samples from patients with histologically proven pulmonary fibrosis (usual interstitial pneumonia) by using oligonucleotide microarrays. Gene expression patterns clearly distinguished normal from fibrotic lungs. Many of the genes that were significantly increased in fibrotic lungs encoded proteins associated with extracellular matrix formation and degradation and proteins expressed in smooth muscle. Using a combined set of scoring systems we determined that matrilysin (matrix metalloproteinase 7), a metalloprotease not previously associated with pulmonary fibrosis, was the most informative increased gene in our data set. Immunohistochemisry demonstrated increased expression of matrilysin protein in fibrotic lungs. Furthermore, matrilysin knockout mice were dramatically protected from pulmonary fibrosis in response to intratracheal bleomycin. Our results identify matrilysin as a mediator of pulmonary fibrosis and a potential therapeutic target. They also illustrate the power of global gene expression analysis of human tissue samples to identify molecular pathways involved in clinical disease.},

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms through which sFRP2 may regulate the growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling of adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). We found that sFRP2 activates CFs in part through canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, as evidenced by increased expression of Axin2 and Wnt3a, but not Wnt5a, as well as accumulation of nuclear β-catenin. In response to sFRP2, CFs exhibited robust cell proliferation associated with increased glucose consumption and lactate production, a phenomenon termed “the Warburg effect” in oncology. The coupling between CF expansion and anaerobic glycolysis is marked by upregulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. In conjunction with these phenotypic changes, CFs accelerated ECM remodeling through upregulation of expression of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and MMP13 genes, two members of the collagenase subfamily, and enzyme activities of MMP2 and MMP9, two members of the gelatinase subfamily. Consistent with the induction of multiple MMPs possessing collagenolytic activities, the steady-state level of collagen type 1 in CF-spent medium was reduced by sFRP2. Analysis of non-CF cell types revealed that the multifaceted effects of sFRP2 on growth control, glucose metabolism, and ECM regulation are largely restricted to CFs and highly sensitive to Wnt signaling perturbation. The study provides a molecular framework on which the functional versatility and signaling complexity of sFRP2 in cardiac fibrosis may be better defined.},

The number of myofibroblasts in SSc skin correlates with the modified Rodnan skin score, the most widely used clinical measure of skin disease severity. Murine fibrosis models indicate that myofibroblasts can arise from a variety of different cell types, but their origin in SSc skin has remained uncertain. Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing, we define different dermal fibroblast populations and transcriptome changes, comparing SSc to healthy dermal fibroblasts. Here, we show that SSc dermal myofibroblasts arise in two steps from an SFRP2hi/DPP4-expressing progenitor fibroblast population. In the first step, SSc fibroblasts show globally upregulated expression of transcriptome markers, such as PRSS23 and THBS1. A subset of these cells shows markers indicating that they are proliferating. Only a fraction of SFRP2hi SSc fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts, as shown by expression of additional markers, SFRP4 and FNDC1. Bioinformatics analysis of the SSc fibroblast transcriptomes implicated upstream transcription factors, including FOSL2, RUNX1, STAT1, FOXP1, IRF7 and CREB3L1, as well as SMAD3, driving SSc myofibroblast differentiation.},

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a life-threatening disease with an unknown etiology. Gene expression microarray data have provided some insights into the molecular mechanisms of IPF. This study aimed to identify key genes and significant signaling pathways involved in IPF using bioinformatics analysis.

Material/Methods
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using integrated analysis of gene expression data with a robust rank aggregation (RRA) method. The Connectivity Map (CMAP) was used to identify gene-expression signatures associated with IPF. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to explore the functional modules involved in the pathogenesis of IPF.

Results
A total of 191 patients with IPF and 101 normal controls from six genome-wide expression datasets were included. CMAP predicted several small molecular agents as potential gene targets in IPF. Several functional modules were detected that showed the highest correlation with IPF, including an extracellular matrix (ECM) component, and a myeloid leukocyte migration and activation component involved in the immune response. Hub genes were identified in the key functional modules that might have a role in the progression of IPF.

Conclusions
WGCNA was used to identify functional modules and hub genes involved in the pathogenesis of IPF.},

First, we provide a guide to identifying and distinguishing lung macrophages from other mononuclear phagocytes in humans and mice.

Single cell analysis of normal hAEC2s and mesenchymal cells in organoid co-cultures revealed the emergence of pathologic fibroblasts and basloid cells previously described in IPF. TGFβ1 and anti-BMP signaling in the organoids promoted transdifferentiation. Trajectory and histologic analyses of both hAEC2-derived organoids and IPF epithelium indicated hAEC2s transdifferentiate into basal cells through alveolar-basal intermediates (ABIs) that accumulate in proximity to pathologic CTHRC1high/TGFB1high fibroblasts.

Because the transcriptional response of fibroblasts to transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) is a determinant of disease progression, we investigated the role of the transcriptional regulator inhibitor of differentiation-1 (Id1) in the setting of lung fibrosis. Mice lacking the gene for Id1 had increased susceptibility to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, and fibroblasts lacking Id1 exhibited enhanced responses to TGF-beta(1). Because the effect of Id1 on fibrosis could not be explained by known mechanisms, we performed protein interaction screening and identified a novel binding partner for Id1, known as dead ringer-like-1 (Dril1). Dril1 shares structural similarities with Id1 and was recently implicated in TGF-beta(1) signaling during embryogenesis. To date, little is known about the function of Dril1 in humans. Although it has not been previously implicated in fibrotic disease, we found that Dril1 was highly expressed in lungs from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and was regulated by TGF-beta(1) in human fibroblasts. Dril1 enhanced activation of TGF-beta(1) target genes, whereas Id1 decreased expression of these same molecules. Id1 inhibited DNA binding by Dril1, and the two proteins co-localized in vitro and in vivo, providing a potential mechanism for suppression of fibrosis by Id1 through inhibition of the profibrotic function of Dril1.},

	abstract = {Targeting molecules involved in TRAIL-mediated signalling has been hailed by many as a potential magic bullet to kill cancer cells efficiently, with little side effects on normal cells. Indeed, initial clinical trials showed that antibodies against TRAIL receptors, death receptor (DR)4 and DR5, are well tolerated by cancer patients. Despite efficacy issues in the clinical setting, novel approaches to trigger TRAIL-mediated apoptosis are being developed and its clinical potential is being reappraised. Unfortunately, as observed with other cancer therapies, many patients develop resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and there is thus impetuous for identifying additional resistance mechanisms that may be targetable and usable in combination therapies. Here, we show that the death-associated protein kinase 2 (DAPK2) is a modulator of TRAIL signalling. Genetic ablation of DAPK2 using RNA interference causes phosphorylation of NF-κB and its transcriptional activity in several cancer cell lines. This then leads to the induction of a variety of NF-κB target genes, which include proapoptotic DR4 and DR5. DR4 and DR5 protein expression is correspondingly increased on the cell surface and this leads to the sensitisation of resistant cells to TRAIL-induced killing, in a p53-independent manner. As DAPK2 is a kinase, it is imminently druggable, and our data thus offer a novel avenue to overcome TRAIL resistance in the clinic.},

In this report, we characterize what we believe is a novel CCR10+ epithelial cell population in IPF lungs. There was a significant increase in the percentage of CCR10+ epithelial cells in IPF relative to normal lung explants and their numbers significantly correlated to lung remodeling in humanized NSG mice. Cultured CCR10-enriched IPF epithelial cells promoted IPF lung fibroblast invasion and collagen 1 secretion. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis showed distinct CCR10+ epithelial cell populations enriched for inflammatory and profibrotic transcripts. Consistently, cultured IPF but not normal epithelial cells induced lung remodeling in humanized NSG mice, where the number of CCR10+ IPF, but not normal, epithelial cells correlated with hydroxyproline concentration in the remodeled NSG lungs. A subset of IPF CCR10hi epithelial cells coexpress EphA3 and ephrin A signaling induces the expression of CCR10 by these cells. Finally, EphA3+CCR10hi epithelial cells induce more consistent lung remodeling in NSG mice relative to EphA3–CCR10lo epithelial cells. Our results suggest that targeting epithelial cells, highly expressing CCR10, may be beneficial in IPF., CCR10+ epithelial cells are abundantly detected in lungs from IPF patients, where these cells promote IPF lung fibroblast invasion, collagen 1 secretion, and lung fibrosis in humanized mice.},

Fibrosis is a pathological feature of many human diseases that affect multiple organs. The development of anti-fibrotic therapies has been a difficult endeavor due to the complexity of signaling pathways associated with fibrogenic processes, complicating the identification and modulation of specific targets. Evidence suggests that ephrin ligands and Eph receptors are crucial signaling molecules that contribute to physiological wound repair and the development of tissue fibrosis. Here, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of ephrin and Eph signaling in tissue repair and fibrosis.

Recent Findings
Ephrin-B2 is implicated in fibrosis of multiple organs. Intercepting its signaling may help counteract fibrosis.

Summary
Ephrins and Eph receptors are candidate mediators of fibrosis. Ephrin-B2, in particular, promotes fibrogenic processes in multiple organs. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting Ephrin-B2 signaling could yield new ways to treat organ fibrosis.},

	abstract = {Stimulation by the ephrin-A1 ligand of the EphA2 receptor increases endothelial permeability. Lung injury increases the expression of EphA2, but the role of EphA2 in such injury is not well understood. To determine whether EphA2 contributes to changes in permeability and inflammation in the injured lung, we studied wild-type (WT) and EphA2 knockout (KO) mice, using isolated, perfused lung (IPL) preparations and a model of bleomycin-induced lung injury. We also studied the response of endothelial cells to ephrin-A1. In the IPL preparations, ephrin-A1 increased the filtration coefficient in WT mice, but not in EphA2 KO mice, demonstrating that EphA2 regulates vascular permeability. In early bleomycin injury in WT mice, the expression of both EphA2 and ephrin-A1 increased. EphA2 KO animals were protected from lung injury, showing less water and alveolar protein in the lungs than WT mice, consistent with reduced permeability. Bleomycin caused less accumulation of lung leukocytes in EphA2 KO animals than in WT animals, suggesting that EphA2 regulates inflammation. To determine whether EphA2 deficiency alters the production of chemokines, CXCL1 and CCL2 in the lungs were measured. After bleomycin injury, EphA2 KO animals produced less CXCL1 and CCL2 than WT animals. Because NF-κβ mediates the production of chemokines, the effect of the ephrin-A1 ligand on the activation of NF-κβ and the expression of chemokines was measured in endothelial cells. Ephrin-a1 significantly increased NF-κβ nuclear translocation and the expression of chemokine mRNA. This study demonstrates that the expression of EphA2 increases in the injured lung, and not only contributes to changes in permeability, but also plays a previously unrecognized role in promoting inflammatory responses.},

Dysregulated B cells have recently been implicated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) pathogenesis., Objectives: To determine if CXCL13 is associated with IPF progression., Methods: CXCL13 was measured in lungs by DNA microarray and immunohistochemistry, and in plasma by ELISA., Measurements and Main Results: CXCL13 mRNA was threefold and eightfold greater in IPF lungs (n = 92) compared with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 191) and normal (n = 108) specimens, respectively (P {\textless} 0.0001). IPF lungs also showed increased CXCL13 staining. Plasma CXCL13 concentrations (pg/ml) were greater in 95 patients with IPF (94 ± 8) than in 128 subjects with COPD (53 ± 9) and 57 normal subjects (35 ± 3) (P {\textless} 0.0001). Circulating CXCL13 levels were highest in patients with IPF with pulmonary artery hypertension (P = 0.01) or acute exacerbations (P = 0.002). Six-month survival of patients with IPF in the highest quartile of plasma CXCL13 was 65 ± 10\% versus 93 ± 10\% in the others (hazard ratio, 5.5; 95\% confidence interval, 1.8–16.9; P = 0.0008). CXCL13 increases by more than 50\% in IPF serial assays, irrespective of initial values, also presaged respiratory failure (hazard ratio, 7.2; 95\% confidence interval, 1.3–40.0; P = 0.008). In contrast, CXCL13 clinical associations in subjects with COPD were limited to modest correlations with FEV1 (P = 0.05) and progression of radiographic emphysema (P = 0.05)., Conclusions: CXCL13 is increased and is a prognostic biomarker in patients with IPF, and more so than in patients with COPD. This contrast indicates CXCL13 overexpressions are intrinsic to IPF, rather than an epiphenomenon of lung injury. The present data implicate CXCL13 and B cells in IPF pathogenesis, and support considerations for trials of specific B-cell–targeted therapies in patients with this intractable disease.},

Accordingly, we examined the concomitant expression of inflammatory CC chemotactic cytokines or chemokines and their corresponding receptors in surgical lung biopsies obtained at the time of disease diagnosis and pulmonary fibroblasts grown from these biopsies. By gene array analysis, upper and lower lobe biopsies and primary fibroblast lines from patients with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease, but not patients without IIP, exhibited CCL7 gene expression. TAQMAN, immunohistochemical, and ELISA analyses confirmed that CCL7 was expressed at significantly higher levels in UIP lung biopsies compared with biopsies from patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease, and from patients without IIP. Higher levels of CCL7 were present in cultures of IIP fibroblasts compared with non-IIP fibroblasts, and CCL5, a CCR5 agonist, significantly increased the synthesis of CCL7 by UIP fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest that CCL7 is highly expressed in biopsies and pulmonary fibroblast lines obtained from patients with UIP relative to patients with other IIP and patients without IIP, and that this CC chemokine may have a major role in the progression of fibrosis in this IIP patient group.},

However, the mechanisms governing this remain to be determined. The current study demonstrated that human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) exhibit high CXCL12 expression and also exhibit high expression of its corresponding receptor CXCR4. Exogenous CXCL12 was revealed to significantly promote the migration and proliferation of HLFs, and potentiate CXCR4 expression. These effects were demonstrated to be inhibited by AMD3100, which is an antagonist of CXCR4. Lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression was upregulated by in vivo bleomycin administration, which was partially inhibited by pre-treatment with AMD3100. AMD3100 also reduced lung collagen content in the bleomycin model. Inhibiting CXCR4 was indicated to ameliorate the lung compliance and resistance of pulmonary fibrosis. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that autocrine CXCR4/CXCL12 axis is an important mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target that can be used in the treatment of pulmonary disease.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)/usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is the severest form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia for which therapeutic targets are needed. Surgical lung biopsy specimens from IPF/UIP patients exhibit focal expression of CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 7, but the identity of these CCR7-positive cells is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to examine the functional and signalling significance of CCR7 expression of primary fibroblasts grown from IPF/UIP and normal surgical lung biopsy specimens. Primary fibroblasts were cultured from surgical lung biopsy specimens from IPF/UIP and normal patients. Fibroblasts treated with or without CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 21 were analysed for functional, transcriptional and proteomic differences using immunocytochemical analysis, gene arrays, Taqman real-time PCR, and migration, proliferation and Western blot assays. CCR7 was expressed by IPF/UIP fibroblasts, but not normal fibroblasts. IPF/UIP fibroblasts, but not normal fibroblasts, showed significant migratory and proliferative responses when exposed to CCL21, which were inhibited by pertussis toxin or neutralising antibodies to CCR7. Exposure of IPF/UIP fibroblasts to CCL21 altered the phosphorylation status of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and ribosomal S6 kinase (90 kDa) in these cells; this was abrogated by pertussis toxin or CCR7-specific small interfering RNA. Together, these data demonstrate that CC chemokine ligand 21 modulates the functional properties of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia fibroblasts, but not normal fibroblasts.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and fatal disease that involves the remodeling of the distal airspace and the lung parenchyma, which results in compromised gas exchange. The median survival time once diagnosed is less than three years. Interleukin (IL)-13 has been shown to play a role in a number of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. IL-13 modulates its effector functions via a complex receptor system that includes the IL-4 receptor (R) α, IL-13Rα1, and the IL-13Rα2. IL-13Rα1 binds IL-13 with low affinity, yet, when it forms a complex with IL-4α, it binds with much higher affinity, inducing the effector functions of IL-13. IL-13Rα2 binds IL-13 with high affinity but has a short cytoplasmic tail and has been shown to act as a nonsignaling decoy receptor. Transfection of fibroblasts and epithelial cells with IL-13Rα2 inhibited the IL-13 induction of soluble collagen, TGF-β, and CCL17. Adenoviral overexpression of IL-13Rα2 in the lung reduced bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Our work shows that overexpression of IL-13Rα2 inhibits the IL-13 induction of fibrotic markers in vitro and inhibits bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In summary our study highlights the antifibrotic nature of IL-13Ra2.},

Objectives: To evaluate the role of these receptors in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Methods: We studied 57 patients: 18 with IPF, 17 with non-IPF (nIPF), 12 with sarcoidosis, and 10 healthy control subjects.

Measurements: We evaluated the expression of CXCR3 and CCR4 in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) T lymphocytes by flow cytometry and the chemokine CXCL10, CXCL11 and CCL17 BAL concentration by singular immunoassay.

Main Results: Patients with IPF had a significantly lower CXCR3 and a higher CCR4 expression on BAL CD4 T cells compared with the other groups. Among patients with IPF, those treated with corticosteroids exhibited higher CXCR3 and lower CCR4 expression compared with untreated patients. CXCR3 expression correlated with BAL lymphocytes and CCR4 with BAL neutrophils and eosinophils. CXCL10 levels correlated with the expression of CXCR3 on BAL CD4 cells. CXCL11 was undetectable in almost all patients, whereas CCL17 was primarily detectable in patients with IPF. The percentage of BAL CCR4CD4 cells negatively correlated with DLCO. The changes in the total lung capacity, VC, and of the alveolar–arterial PO2 gradient in patients with IPF and those with nIPF 6 to 12 mo after the first evaluation were associated with CD4CXCR3 percentage on BAL cells.

Conclusions: We found an imbalance in CXCR3/CCR4 expression on BAL CD4 lymphocytes and reduced CXCL10 BAL levels in patients with IPF, suggesting a pivotal role of these molecules in IPF.},

Relevant categories include chemokines and growth factors and their receptors, complement components, genes associated with cell proliferation and death, and genes in the Wnt pathway. The role of the chemokine CXCL12 in disease pathogenesis was confirmed in the murine bleomycin model of lung injury, with C57BL/6CXCR4+/− mice demonstrating significantly less collagen deposition than C57BL/6CXCR4+/+ mice.

	abstract = {Background
The molecular pathways involved in the interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are poorly understood. Systems biology approaches, with global expression data sets, were used to identify perturbed gene networks, to gain some understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and to develop specific hypotheses relevant to these chronic lung diseases.

Methods
Lung tissue samples from patients with different types of ILD were obtained from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium and total cell RNA was isolated. Global mRNA and microRNA were profiled by hybridization and amplification-based methods. Differentially expressed genes were compiled and used to identify critical signaling pathways and potential biomarkers. Modules of genes were identified that formed a regulatory network, and studies were performed on cultured cells in vitro for comparison with the in vivo results.

Results
By profiling mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression levels, we found subsets of differentially expressed genes that distinguished patients with ILDs from controls and that correlated with different disease stages and subtypes of ILDs. Network analysis, based on pathway databases, revealed several disease-associated gene modules, involving genes from the TGF-β, Wnt, focal adhesion, and smooth muscle actin pathways that are implicated in advancing fibrosis, a critical pathological process in ILDs. A more comprehensive approach was also adapted to construct a putative global gene regulatory network based on the perturbation of key regulatory elements, transcription factors and microRNAs. Our data underscores the importance of TGF-β signaling and the persistence of smooth muscle actin-containing fibroblasts in these diseases. We present evidence that, downstream of TGF-β signaling, microRNAs of the miR-23a cluster and the transcription factor Zeb1 could have roles in mediating an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the resultant persistence of mesenchymal cells in these diseases.

Conclusions
We present a comprehensive overview of the molecular networks perturbed in ILDs, discuss several potential key molecular regulatory circuits, and identify microRNA species that may play central roles in facilitating the progression of ILDs. These findings advance our understanding of these diseases at the molecular level, provide new molecular signatures in defining the specific characteristics of the diseases, suggest new hypotheses, and reveal new potential targets for therapeutic intervention.},

	abstract = {Background
The clinical-radiographic distinction between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is challenging. We sought to investigate the gene expression profiles of IPF and NSIP vs. normal controls.

Methods
Gene expression from explanted lungs of patients with IPF (n = 22), NSIP (n = 10) and from normal controls (n = 11) was assessed. Microarray analysis included Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM), Ingenuity Pathway, Gene-Set Enrichment and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses. Immunohistochemistry and serology of proteins of interest were conducted.

Results
NSIP cases were significantly enriched for genes related to mechanisms of immune reaction, such as T-cell response and recruitment of leukocytes into the lung compartment. In IPF, in contrast, these involved senescence, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, myofibroblast differentiation and collagen deposition. Unlike the IPF group, NSIP cases exhibited a strikingly homogenous gene signature. Clustering analysis identified a subgroup of IPF patients with intermediate and ambiguous expression of SAM-selected genes, with the interesting upregulation of both NSIP-specific and senescence-related genes. Immunohistochemistry for p16, a senescence marker, on fibroblasts differentiated most IPF cases from NSIP. Serial serum levels of periostin, a senescence effector, predicted clinical progression in a cohort of patients with IPF.

Conclusions
Comprehensive gene expression profiling in explanted lungs identifies distinct transcriptional profiles and differentially expressed genes in IPF and NSIP, supporting the notion of NSIP as a standalone condition. Potential gene and protein markers to discriminate IPF from NSIP were identified, with a prominent role of senescence in IPF. The finding of a subgroup of IPF patients with transcriptional features of both NSIP and senescence raises the hypothesis that “senescent” NSIP may represent a risk factor to develop superimposed IPF.

	abstract = {Purpose of Review
This review presents an overview of the current knowledge of TRAF molecules in inflammation with an emphasis on available human evidence and direct in vivo evidence of mouse models that demonstrate the contribution of TRAF molecules in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.

Recent Findings
The tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R)-associated factor (TRAF) family of cytoplasmic proteins was initially identified as signaling adaptors that bind directly to the intracellular domains of receptors of the TNF-R superfamily. It is now appreciated that TRAF molecules are widely employed in signaling by a variety of adaptive and innate immune receptors as well as cytokine receptors. TRAF-dependent signaling pathways typically lead to the activation of nuclear factor-κBs (NF-κBs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), or interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs). Most of these signaling pathways have been linked to inflammation, and therefore TRAF molecules were expected to regulate inflammation and inflammatory responses since their discovery in 1990s. However, direct in vivo evidence of TRAFs in inflammation and especially in inflammatory diseases had been lacking for many years, partly due to the difficulty imposed by early lethality of TRAF2−/−, TRAF3−/−, and TRAF6−/− mice. With the creation of conditional knockout and lineage-specific transgenic mice of different TRAF molecules, our understanding about TRAFs in inflammation and inflammatory responses has rapidly advanced during the past decade.

Summary
Increasing evidence indicates that TRAF molecules are versatile and indispensable regulators of inflammation and inflammatory responses and that aberrant expression or function of TRAFs contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.},

TNF-α binds to two different receptors, which initiate signal transduction pathways. These pathways lead to various cellular responses, including cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation. However, the inappropriate or excessive activation of TNF-α signaling is associated with chronic inflammation and can eventually lead to the development of pathological complications such as autoimmune diseases. Understanding of the TNF-α signaling mechanism has been expanded and applied for the treatment of immune diseases, which has resulted in the development of effective therapeutic tools, including TNF-α inhibitors. Currently, clinically approved TNF-α inhibitors have shown noticeable potency in a variety of autoimmune diseases, and novel TNF-α signaling inhibitors are being clinically evaluated. In this review, we briefly introduce the impact of TNF-α signaling on autoimmune diseases and its inhibitors, which are used as therapeutic agents against autoimmune diseases.},

Fibrosis, the replacement of functional tissue with excessive fibrous tissue, can occur in all the main tissues and organ systems, resulting in various pathological disorders. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is a prototype fibrotic disease involving abnormal wound healing in response to multiple sites of ongoing alveolar epithelial injury.

Methodology/Principal Findings
To decipher the role of TNF and TNF-mediated inflammation in the development of fibrosis, we have utilized the bleomycin-induced animal model of Pulmonary Fibrosis and a series of genetically modified mice lacking components of TNF signaling. Transmembrane TNF expression is shown to be sufficient to elicit an inflammatory response, but inadequate for the transition to the fibrotic phase of the disease. Soluble TNF expression is shown to be crucial for lymphocyte recruitment, a prerequisite for TGF-b1 expression and the development of fibrotic lesions. Moreover, through a series of bone marrow transfers, the necessary TNF expression is shown to originate from the non-hematopoietic compartment further localized in apoptosing epithelial cells.

Conclusions
These results suggest a primary detrimental role of soluble TNF in the pathologic cascade, separating it from the beneficial role of transmembrane TNF, and indicate the importance of assessing the efficacy of soluble TNF antagonists in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.},

Effective therapies to treat patients with IPF are lacking, and conventional therapy may be harmful. We tested the hypothesis that therapeutic lung delivery of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α into wild-type fibrotic mice would reduce the profibrotic milieu and accelerate the resolution of established pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrosis was assessed in bleomycin-instilled wild-type and TNF-α−/− mice by measuring hydroxyproline levels, static compliance, and Masson’s trichrome staining. Macrophage infiltration and programming status was assessed by flow cytometry of enzymatically digested lung and in situ immunostaining. Pulmonary delivery of TNF-α to wild-type mice with established pulmonary fibrosis was found to reduce their fibrotic burden, to improve lung function and architecture, and to reduce the number and programming status of profibrotic alternatively programmed macrophages. In contrast, fibrosis and alternative macrophage programming were prolonged in bleomycin-instilled TNF-α−/− mice. To address the role of the reduced numbers of alternatively programmed macrophages in the TNF-α–induced resolution of established pulmonary fibrosis, we conditionally depleted macrophages in MAFIA (MAcrophage Fas-Induced Apoptosis) mice. Conditional macrophage depletion phenocopied the resolution of established pulmonary fibrosis observed after therapeutic TNF-α delivery. Taken together, our results show for the first time that TNF-α is involved in the resolution of established pulmonary fibrosis via a mechanism involving reduced numbers and programming status of profibrotic macrophages. We speculate that pulmonary delivery of TNF-α or augmenting its signaling pathway represent a novel therapeutic strategy to resolve established pulmonary fibrosis.},

In this study, we found that the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 subunit were both upregulated in bleomycin-induced fibrotic lung tissue. In addition, we discovered that TNF-α promotes myofibroblast differentiation of LR-MSCs through activating NF-κB signaling. Interestingly, we also found that TNF-α promotes the expression of β-catenin. Moreover, we demonstrated that suppression of the NF-κB signaling could attenuate myofibroblast differentiation of LR-MSCs and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis which were accompanied with decreased expression of β-catenin.

The Wnt ligand ultimately results in the stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin, which is then free to enter the nucleus and activate transcription through its interaction with the transcription factor TCF4. Our laboratory recently found that KLF4, a transcription factor highly expressed in the adult intestine and critical for intestinal differentiation, interacts with β-catenin and inhibits Wnt signaling. In this study, we characterize the molecular mechanisms of KLF4-mediated inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We find that the KLF4 directly interacts with the C-terminal transactivation domain of β-catenin and inhibits p300/CBP recruitment by β-catenin. KLF4 inhibits p300/CBP-mediated β-catenin acetylation as well as histone acetylation on Wnt target genes. In addition, we observe that KLF4 directly interacts with TCF4 independently of β-catenin and that KLF4 and TCF4 are expressed in similar patterns within the large intestine, with greatest staining near the epithelial surface. These results provide a deeper understanding of the regulation of β-catenin in the intestine and will have important implications in cancer and stem cell research.},

Tensin (TNS) 1 is a key component of specialized cellular adhesions (fibrillar adhesions) that bind to extracellular fibronectin fibrils. We hypothesized that TNS1 may play a role in modulating myofibroblast-mediated matrix formation. We found that TNS1 expression is increased in fibroblastic foci from lungs with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β profoundly up-regulates TNS1 expression with kinetics that parallel the expression of the myofibroblast marker, smooth muscle α-actin. TGF-β-induced TNS1 expression is dependent on signaling through the TGF-β receptor 1 and is Rho coiled-coiled kinase/actin/megakaryoblastic leukemia-1/serum response factor dependent. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TNS1 disrupted TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation, without affecting TGF-β/Smad signaling. In contrast, loss of TNS1 resulted in disruption of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, focal adhesion formation, and actin stress fiber development. Finally, TNS1 was essential for the formation of fibrillar adhesions and the assembly of nascent fibronectin and collagen matrix in myofibroblasts. In summary, our data show that TNS1 is a novel megakaryoblastic leukemia-1-dependent gene that is induced during pulmonary fibrosis. TNS1 plays an essential role in TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation and myofibroblast-mediated formation of extracellular fibronectin and collagen matrix. Targeted disruption of TNS1 and associated signaling may provide an avenue to inhibit tissue fibrosis.},

	abstract = {Chronic organ injury leads to fibrosis and eventually organ failure. Fibrosis is characterized by excessive synthesis, remodeling, and contraction of extracellular matrix produced by myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are the key cells in the pathophysiology of fibrotic disorders and their differentiation can be triggered by multiple stimuli. To develop anti-fibrotic therapies, it is of paramount importance to understand the molecular basis of the signaling pathways contributing to the activation and maintenance of myofibroblasts. Several signal transduction pathways, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, Wingless/Int (WNT), and more recently yes-associated protein 1 (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) signaling, have been linked to the pathophysiology of fibrosis. Activation of the TGF-β1-induced SMAD complex results in the upregulation of genes important for myofibroblast function. Similarly, WNT-stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and initiates transcription of its target genes. YAP and TAZ are two transcriptional co-activators from the Hippo signaling pathway that also rely on nuclear translocation for their functioning. These three signal transduction pathways have little molecular similarity but do share one principle: the cytosolic/nuclear regulation of its transcriptional activators. Past research on these pathways often focused on the isolated cascades without taking other signaling pathways into account. Recent developments show that parts of these pathways converge into an intricate network that governs the activation and maintenance of the myofibroblast phenotype. In this review, we discuss the current understanding on the signal integration between the TGF-β, WNT, and YAP/TAZ pathways in the development of organ fibrosis. Taking a network-wide view on signal transduction will provide a better understanding on the complex and versatile processes that underlie the pathophysiology of fibrotic disorders.},

	abstract = {Background
Recurrence and metastasis are the major problems of bladder urothelial carcinoma, which mainly attribute to tumor cell stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemoresistance.
Methods
TCGA database was interrogated for gene mRNA expression in bladder urothelial carcinoma samples. CCLE database was interrogated for gene mRNA expression in bladder cancer cell lines. The correlation between two genes was analyzed by Pearson statistics. 37 human bladder urothelial carcinoma specimens were adopted for immunohistochemistry. Bladder cancer cells RT4, J82, and UM-UC-3 were used to carry out loss and gain of function studies. Kaplan-Meier method was performed to analyze the overall survival.
Findings
WNT7B is downregulated in high-grade bladder urothelial carcinomas. Low WNT7B expression is associated with unfavorable prognosis. Loss and gain of function studies showed that WNT7B inhibits bladder urothelial carcinoma cell EMT, stem-like properties and chemoresistance. FZD5, a specific receptor for WNT7B, mediates WNT7B signaling. ELF3 is a downstream component of WNT7B signaling, which transcriptionally modulates NOTCH1, a tumor suppressor in bladder urothelial carcinoma.
Interpretation
These data demonstrate that WNT7B/FZD5-ELF3-NOTCH1 signaling functions as a tumor-suppressing pathway in bladder urothelial carcinoma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frizzled (FZD) proteins function as receptors for WNT ligands. Members in FZD family including FZD2, FZD4, FZD7, FZD8 and FZD10 have been demonstrated to mediate cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
METHODS: CCLE and TCGA databases were interrogated to reveal the association of FZD5 with EMT. EMT was analyzed by investigating the alterations in CDH1 (E-cadherin), VIM (Vimentin) and ZEB1 expression, cell migration and cell morphology. Transcriptional modulation was determined by ChIP in combination with Real-time PCR. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: In contrast to other FZDs, FZD5 was identified to prevent EMT in gastric cancer. FZD5 maintains epithelial-like phenotype and is negatively modulated by transcription factors SNAI2 and TEAD1. Epithelial-specific factor ELF3 is a downstream effecter, and protein kinase C (PKC) links FZD5 to ELF3. ELF3 represses ZEB1 expression, further guarding against EMT. Moreover, FZD5 signaling requires its co-receptor LRP5 and WNT7B is a putative ligand for FZD5. FZD5 and ELF3 are associated with longer survival, whereas SNAI2 and TEAD1 are associated with shorter survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, FZD5-ELF3 signaling blocks EMT, and plays a potential tumor-suppressing role in gastric cancer. Video Abstract.},

Mechanisms underlying autophagy disruption in IPF are unclear and may involve regulation of USP (ubiquitin-specific protease) by post-translational modifications. To expand our previous observation of low USP13 expression in IPF, this study evaluated the role of USP13 in age-related lung fibrosis. Here, we demonstrated that Usp13-deficient aged mice exhibited impaired autophagic activity and increased vulnerability to bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Mechanistically, USP13 interacted with and deubiquitinated Beclin 1, and Beclin 1 overexpression abolished the effects of USP13 disruption. In addition, Beclin 1 inhibition resulted in insufficient autophagy and more severe lung fibrosis after bleomycin injury, consistent with the phenotype of aged Usp13-deficient mice. Collectively, we show a protective role of USP13 in age-related pulmonary fibrosis. Aging-mediated USP13 loss impairs autophagic activity and facilitates lung fibrosis through Beclin 1 deubiquitination. Our findings support the notion that age-dependent dysregulation of autophagic regulators enhances vulnerability to lung fibrosis.},

The type III TGF-β (TβRIII or betaglycan) is a transmembrane proteoglycan without a functional kinase domain, and is considered as a coreceptor to increase the affinity of ligand binding to TβRII. Little is studied on TGF-β and TβRIII (or betaglycan) signaling, while it is well known about TGF-β ligand and TβRII signaling. In this study, we investigated the effects of TβRIII expression on TGF-β induced differentiation, in view of the finding that TβRIII is significantly downregulated during TGF-β-induced differentiation in fibroblasts. TGF-beta induced alpha-SMA and Procollagen Type I expression were markedly inhibited in fibroblasts stably expressing TβRIII. Endogenous TβRIII expression did not alter the TβRI or TβRII levels, but inhibited Smad 2/3, Akt and ERK phosphorylation. The molecular mechanism of TβRIII action in TGF-β-induced differentiation is associated with both Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways. Our results suggest that TβRIII is a novel molecular target for regulation of TGF-β signaling in myofibroblast differentiation.},

While the contribution of IL-4 and IL-13 to allergic lung inflammation has been studied extensively, the functional significance of the IRS2 pathway is unclear. To examine the role of IRS2 in allergic disease, we evaluated responses in IRS2-deficient mice. Deficiency of IRS2 resulted in a substantial increase in expression of a subset of genes associated with alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) in response to IL-4 or IL-13 in vitro. Moreover, IRS2+/− and IRS2−/− mice developed enhanced pulmonary inflammation, accumulation of eosinophils and AAM, and airway and vascular remodeling upon allergen stimulation in comparison to IRS2+/+ mice; this enhanced response was in part macrophage intrinsic. Loss of IRS2 led to greater phosphorylation of Akt and ribosomal S6 protein in the basal state and upon IL-4 stimulation. Thus, we identify a critical negative regulatory loop downstream of IRS2, demonstrating a previously unrecognized role for IRS2 in suppressing allergic lung inflammation and remodeling.},

Defective insulin signaling is associated with ageing, tissue dysfunction, and impaired wound healing. In the liver, insulin resistance leads to chronic damage and fibrosis, but it is unclear how tissue-repair mechanisms integrate insulin signals to coordinate an appropriate injury response or how they are affected by insulin resistance. In this study, we demonstrate that insulin resistance impairs local cellular crosstalk between the fibrotic stroma and bipotent adult liver progenitor cells (LPCs), whose paracrine interactions promote epithelial repair and tissue remodeling. Using insulin-resistant mice deficient for insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2), we highlight dramatic impairment of proregenerative fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) signaling between stromal niche cells and LPCs during chronic injury. We provide a detailed account of the role played by IRS2 in promoting Fgf7 ligand and receptor (Fgfr2-IIIb) expression by the two cell compartments, and we describe an insulin/IRS2-dependent feed-forward loop capable of sustaining hepatic re-epithelialization by driving FGFR2-IIIb expression. Finally, we shed light on the regulation of IRS2 and FGF7 within the fibrotic stroma and show—using a human coculture system—that IRS2 silencing shifts the equilibrium away from paracrine epithelial repair in favor of fibrogenesis. Hence, we offer a compelling insight into the contribution of insulin resistance to the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease and propose IRS2 as a positive regulator of communication between cell types and the transition between phases of stromal to epithelial repair.},

Thus, understanding these key mechanisms and pathways modulating both is essential to greater understanding of IPF pathogenesis. We examined the association of VEGF with the IPF disease state and preclinical models in vivo and in vitro. Tissue and circulating levels of VEGF were significantly reduced in patients with IPF, particularly in those with a rapidly progressive phenotype, compared with healthy controls. Lung-specific overexpression of VEGF significantly protected mice following intratracheal bleomycin challenge, with a decrease in fibrosis and bleomycin-induced cell death observed in the VEGF transgenic mice. In vitro, apoptotic endothelial cell–derived mediators enhanced epithelial cell injury and reduced epithelial wound closure. This process was rescued by VEGF pretreatment of the endothelial cells via a mechanism involving thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). Taken together, these data indicate beneficial roles for VEGF during lung fibrosis via modulating epithelial homeostasis through a previously unrecognized mechanism involving the endothelium., Elevated VEGF is associated with less severe disease in IPF patients, and VEGF overexpression ameliorates bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in a murine model.},

Infiltration of inflammatory cells and vascular remodeling are both keystones of this process. However, the role of inflammation and angiogenesis in general and, more specifically, the significance of inflammatory cell-derived VEGF in this context are unclear. To determine the role of inflammatory cell-derived VEGF in a clinically relevant and chronically inflamed injury, pulmonary fibrosis, we deleted the VEGF-A gene in myeloid cells. In a model of pulmonary fibrosis in mice, deletion of VEGF in myeloid cells resulted in significantly reduced formation of blood vessels; however, it causes aggravated fibrotic tissue damage. This was accompanied by a pronounced decrease in epithelial cell survival and a striking increase in myofibroblast invasion. The drastic increase in fibrosis following loss of myeloid VEGF in the damaged lungs was also marked by increased levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) expression and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. This demonstrates that the process of angiogenesis, driven by myeloid cell-derived VEGF, is essential for the prevention of fibrotic damage.},

Flt-1 is one of the specific receptors for VEGF, and soluble flt-1 (sflt-1) binds to VEGF and competitively inhibits it from binding to the receptors. We examined the role of VEGF in the pathophysiology of bleomycin-induced pneumopathy in mice, using a new therapeutic strategy that comprises transfection of the sflt-1 gene into skeletal muscles as a biofactory for anti-VEGF therapy. The serum levels of sflt-1 were significantly increased at 3-14 days after the gene transfer. Transfection of the sflt-1 gene at 3 days before or 7 days after the intratracheal instillation of bleomycin decreased the number of inflammatory cells, the protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and with von Willebrand factor expression at 14 days. Transfection of the sflt-1 gene also attenuated pulmonary fibrosis and apoptosis at 14 days. Since the inflammatory cell infiltration begins at 3 days and is followed by interstitial fibrosis, it is likely that VEGF has important roles as a proinflammatory, a permeability-inducing, and an angiogenesis factor not only in the early inflammatory phase but also in the late fibrotic phase. Furthermore, this method may be beneficial for treating lung injury and fibrosis from the viewpoint of clinical application, since it does not require the use of a viral vector or neutralizing Ab.},

Rats exposed to a single intra-tracheal injection of bleomycin were treated with BIBF 1000 starting 10 days after bleomycin administration. To gauge for anti-fibrotic activity, collagen deposition and pro-fibrotic growth factor gene expression was analysed in isolated lungs. Furthermore, the activity of BIBF 1000 was compared with imatinib mesylate (combined PDGF receptor, c-kit and c-abl kinase inhibitor) and SB-431542 (transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor I kinase inhibitor) in an ex vivo TGF-beta-driven fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation assay, performed in primary human bronchial fibroblasts. Treatment of rats with BIBF 1000 resulted in the attenuation of fibrosis as assessed by the reduction of collagen deposition and the inhibition of pro-fibrotic gene expression. In the cellular assay both SB-431542 and BIBF 1000 showed dose-dependent inhibition of TGF-beta-induced differentiation, whereas imatinib mesylate was inactive.

These growth factors are profibrotic and each has been investigated as a potential standalone therapeutic target in IPF. Simultaneous inhibition of these receptors, with an analog of nintedanib, has proved to be effective in experimental animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. This observation, together with extensive safety and pharmacokinetic data from studies of nintedanib in malignancy, paved the way for the clinical development of this drug in IPF. The Phase IIb TOMORROW trial demonstrated that treatment with nintedanib may potentially slow decline in lung function, decrease the frequency of acute exacerbations, and improve quality of life in patients with IPF. While these observations are drawn from a single clinical trial, taken together with the preclinical data they suggest that nintedanib may yet become an important therapeutic option for individuals with IPF. The results of ongoing parallel, international, multicenter Phase III clinical trials are therefore eagerly awaited.},

We demonstrated that vascular density is regionally decreased in IPF within the fibroblastic foci, and that within these areas PEDF was increased, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor was decreased. PEDF colocalized with the fibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, particularly within the fibrotic interstitium and the fibroblastic focus, and prominently within the epithelium directly overlying the fibroblastic focus. This suggested that TGF-beta 1 might regulate PEDF expression. Using 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and human lung fibroblasts, we showed that PEDF was indeed a TGF-beta 1 target gene.

The secretion and expression of VEGF were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The isoforms of released VEGF were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. BEAS-2B cells and A549 cells released VEGF constitutively. Interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha augmented the release of VEGF in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The released VEGF was 165 amino acid residues in either condition. Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon (IFN)-gamma, smoke extract (SE), neutrophil elastase (NE), and bradykinin stimulated the release of VEGF. Keracinocyte growth factor (KGF), which reduces vascular permeability, also stimulated both cells to release VEGF. VEGF messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was expressed both time- and dose-dependently at 2 h, and declined after 2 h in response to IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. The expression of VEGF mRNA in airway epithelial cells was also augmented by LPS, IFN-gamma, SE, NE, and KGF stimulation.

The aim of this study was to examine the clinical significance of the serum VEGF level for evaluating disease severity and progression. The levels of VEGF in serum were measured in 41 patients with IPF, 14 patients with lung cancer, and 43 healthy volunteers. We measured the serum levels of CRP, LDH, KL-6, SP-D, and the parameters obtained from arterial blood gas analysis and pulmonary function tests. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed to determine the extent of the interstitial and the alveolar opacities. The ability of each biomarker to predict disease severity was estimated by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The VEGF levels of IPF patients with high alveolar-arterial difference of oxygen (AaDO(2)) levels were significantly elevated than those with low AaDO(2) levels and those of healthy volunteers. When examined within the IPF group, a significant positive correlation was found between the VEGF levels and the HRCT interstitial score (p = 0.027) and the KL-6 levels (p = 0.037). Among several serum biomarkers, VEGF showed the largest AUC for predicting disease severity as defined by a high AaDO(2) value. There was an inverse correlation between the baseline VEGF level and the monthly change in percent predicted vital capacity. The serum VEGF level may reflect the severity of IPF and offer clinical benefits to predict the disease's progression.},

We measured VEGF165 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from normal volunteers (NVs) of varying age and from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), sarcoidosis, or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). A considerable gradient in VEGF levels was found with relatively high VEGF concentrations in BALF as compared with serum VEGF. VEGF levels were 303 +/- 34 pg/mL (mean +/- SEM) in serum samples from patients with CF (N = 9) versus 122 +/- 16 pg/mL for the comparable, youngest group of NVs (P {\textless} .01). BALF VEGF concentrations were 165 +/- 17 pg/mL for CF upper lobe BALF (N = 9), 140 +/- 17 pg/mL for CF lower lobe BALF (N = 9), and 235 +/- 24 pg/mL for young adult NVs (N = 29). Serum VEGF levels did not differ significantly between NVs and patients with interstitial lung disease, but mean BALF VEGF levels declined significantly with advancing age in NVs and were significantly depressed in patients with IPF (32 +/- 6 pg/mL) as compared with all other groups, including the oldest group of NVs (134 +/- 13 pg/mL, P {\textless} .0001). We conclude that a considerable gradient in VEGF concentration exists from epithelial bronchoalveolar surface fluid to serum.

	abstract = {Rationale: Fibrosis after lung injury is related to poor outcome, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can be regarded as an exemplar. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A has been implicated in this context, but there are conflicting reports as to whether it is a contributory or protective factor. Differential splicing of the VEGF-A gene produces multiple functional isoforms including VEGF-A165a and VEGF-A165b, a member of the inhibitory family. To date there is no clear information on the role of VEGF-A in IPF., Objectives: To establish VEGF-A isoform expression and functional effects in IPF., Methods: We used tissue sections, plasma, and lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF and control subjects. In a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model we used wild-type MMTV mice and a triple transgenic mouse SPC-rtTA+/−TetoCre+/−LoxP-VEGF-A+/+ to conditionally induce VEGF-A isoform deletion specifically in the alveolar type II (ATII) cells of adult mice., Measurements and Main Results: IPF and normal lung fibroblasts differentially expressed and responded to VEGF-A165a and VEGF-A165b in terms of proliferation and matrix expression. Increased VEGF-A165b was detected in plasma of progressing patients with IPF. In a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, ATII-specific deficiency of VEGF-A or constitutive overexpression of VEGF-A165b inhibited the development of pulmonary fibrosis, as did treatment with intraperitoneal delivery of VEGF-A165b to wild-type mice., Conclusions: These results indicate that changes in the bioavailability of VEGF-A sourced from ATII cells, namely the ratio of VEGF-Axxxa to VEGF-Axxxb, are critical in development of pulmonary fibrosis and may be a paradigm for the regulation of tissue repair.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT:
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) are diffuse parenchymal lung diseases characterized by a mixture of inflammation and fibrosis, leading to lung destruction and finally death.

AIMS:
The aim of this study was to compare different pathophysiological mechanisms, such as angiogenesis, coagulation, fibrosis, tissue repair, inflammation, epithelial damage, oxidative stress, and matrix remodeling, in both disorders using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).

METHODS:
At diagnosis, patients underwent bronchoscopy with BAL and were divided into three groups: Control (n = 10), HP (n = 11), and IPF (n = 11), based on multidisciplinary approach (clinical examination, radiology, and histology): Multiplex searchlight technology was used to analyze 25 proteins representative for different pathophysiological processes: Eotaxin, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGFb), fibronectin, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), interleukine (IL)-8, IL-12p40, IL-17, IL-23, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), myeloperoxidase (MPO), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8, MMP-9, active plasminogen activating inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), pulmonary activation regulated chemokine (PARC), placental growth factor (PlGF), protein-C, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES), surfactant protein-C (SP-C), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), tissue factor, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

RESULTS:
All patients suffered from decreased pulmonary function and abnormal BAL cell differential compared with control. Protein levels were increased in both IPF and HP for MMP-8 (P = 0.022), MMP-9 (P = 0.0020), MCP-1 (P = 0.0006), MDC (P = 0.0048), IL-8 (P = 0.013), MPO (P = 0.019), and protein-C (P = 0.0087), whereas VEGF was decreased (P = 0.0003) compared with control. HGF was upregulated in HP (P = 0.0089) and active PAI-1 was upregulated (P = 0.019) in IPF compared with control. Differences in expression between IPF and HP were observed for IL-12p40 (P = 0.0093) and TGF-β1 (P = 0.0045).

CONCLUSIONS:
Using BAL, we demonstrated not only expected similarities but also important differences in both disorders, many related to the innate immunity. These findings provide new clues for further research in both disorders.},

	abstract = {Angiogenesis is an essential process required for growth and tissue repair after injury, but it may also contribute to the pathology of a number of human disorders including neoplasias, atherosclerosis and inflammatory diseases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic peptide upregulated by many cytokines and endothelium shear stresses. Lung is a highly vascular tissue with finely organized and regulated microvascular beds, and its inflammation may lead to dysregulated angiogenesis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a lung disorder characterized by chronic lymphocytic inflammation and endothelial damage. However, neovascularization has not been previously explored. In this study, we examined the expression and localization of VEGF in 38 patients with HP and 14 healthy control subjects (CS). VEGF levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured by ELISA, and cellular lung localization was determined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, VEGF expression was analyzed in lung tissue by RT-PCR. Our results showed sera levels significantly increased in HP patients compared with CS (209.3 +/- 189.3 vs. 55.3 +/- 31.4 pg/ml; p = 0.004). By contrast, BALF levels of VEGF were significantly decreased in HP patients compared with CS (35.3 +/- 51.5 pg/ml vs. 185.1 +/- 191.4 pg/ml; p {\textless} 0.001). VEGF was primary expressed by epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and interstitial macrophages in HP tissue. Flt-1 and Flk-1 receptors were highly expressed by endothelial cells from medium and small vessels in HP tissue. By RT-PCR the VEGF RNA was increased compared with those in normal lung. Our results suggest that abnormal expression of VEGF may contribute to impair the lung repair in HP.},

	abstract = {Background
Antigen presenting cells play a pivotal role in the adaptive immune response in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). It was hypothesised that lymphangiogenesis is involved in the pathophysiology of HP via cell transport.

Objective
To determine the clinical significance of lymphangiogenic factors in HP.

Methods
Levels of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and CCL21 in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured in 29 healthy volunteers, 14 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 26 patients with HP by ELISA. Additionally, immunohistochemical analyses were performed using lung specimens of patients with HP (n=8) and IPF (n=10).

Results
BALF VEGF-D levels were significantly elevated in patients with HP compared to the other groups. BALF VEGF–D levels in patients with HP correlated significantly with the BALF total cell and lymphocyte counts (r=0.485, p=0.014 and r=0.717, p{\textless}0.0001, respectively). BALF VEGF-C and CCL21 levels were increased in patients with HP compared to healthy volunteers, but not patients with IPF. BALF CCL21 levels were negatively correlated with the forced expiratory volume in 1 s percentage and diffuse capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (r=−0.662, p=0.007 and r=−0.671, p=0.024, respectively). According to the immunohistochemical analyses, CCL21 was expressed in the lymphatic endothelium in both conditions and CCR7+ cells were aggregated around lymphatics in patients with HP, but not in patients with IPF.

Conclusions
Lymphangiogenic factors might be associated with the inflammatory and functional severity of HP. The increased BALF VEGF-D levels were associated with lymphatic alveolitis intensity, and CCL21 with lung function impairment.},

This observation has led to controversy over the role of this potent molecule in lung physiology and disease. We hypothesized that some of the VEGF previously detected in normal lung may be of the anti-angiogenic family (VEGFxxxb) with significant potential effects on VEGF bioactivity. VEGFxxxb protein expression was assessed by indirect immunohistochemistry in normal and ARDS tissue. Expression of VEGFxxxb was also detected by immunoblotting in normal lung tissue, primary human alveolar type II (ATII) cells, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in normal subjects and by ELISA in normal, “at risk,” and ARDS subjects. The effect of VEGF165 and VEGF165b on both human primary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cell proliferation was assessed by [3H]thymidine uptake. We found that VEGF165b was widely expressed in normal healthy lung tissue but is reduced in ARDS lung. VEGF121b and VEGF165b were present in whole lung, BAL, and ATII lysate. The proliferative effect of VEGF165 on both human primary endothelial cells and human alveolar epithelial cells was significantly inhibited by VEGF165b (P {\textless} 0.01). These data demonstrate that the novel VEGFxxxb family members are expressed in normal lung and are reduced in ARDS. A specific functional effect on primary human endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells has also been shown. These data suggest that the VEGFxxxb family may have a role in repair after lung injury.},

IL-7 inhibited both TGF-β production and signaling in fibroblasts and required an intact JAK1/STAT1 signal transduction pathway. IL-7–mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling was found to be associated with an increase in Smad7, a major inhibitory regulator in the SMAD family. In the presence of IL-7, Smad7 dominant negative fibroblasts restored TGF-β–induced collagen synthesis, indicating that an IL-7–mediated increase in Smad7 suppressed TGF-β signaling. Consistent with these in vitro findings, recombinant IL-7 decreased bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo, independent of IFN-γ.

	abstract = {AIMS: The separation of fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (FNSIP) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is important for patient treatment and prognosis, but is sometimes a difficult diagnostic problem. Most authors believe that fibroblast foci are rare in NSIP, and that the finding of multiple fibroblast foci suggests a diagnosis of UIP. Similarly, architectural distortion is viewed as favouring a diagnosis of UIP. This study aims to assess these criteria for their diagnostic utility.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We report eight patients with a high-resolution computed tomography diagnosis of FNSIP, and a picture of fibrotic NSIP on biopsy, but in whom, in all cases, fibrosis focally widened the walls to the point of confluence, producing architectural distortion in the form of variably sized, sometimes quite large, blocks of fibrosis, but not honeycombing. Fibroblast foci varied from four to nine per section, and point counting morphometry showed that the areas containing large blocks of confluent fibrosis were geographically strongly associated with fibroblast foci, whereas fibroblast foci were rare away from the confluent fibrosis. Follow-up imaging studies (mean interval 19.5 months; range 2-42 months) in six patients revealed stable or improved disease in four and worsening disease in two. No case had or developed radiological honeycombing, and there were no other imaging findings to suggest a diagnosis of UIP.
CONCLUSIONS: Otherwise typical FNSIP cases can show architectural distortion caused by confluence or marked expansion of fibrotic alveolar walls. These areas tend to be associated with fibroblast foci. These findings do not imply a poor prognosis, and should not be confused with UIP.},

Identifying novel mediators of pulmonary fibrosis is currently needed to facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic strategies targeting pulmonary fibrosis. The present study was designed to investigate whether transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) induced protein (TGFBI), an extracellular matrix protein, regulates pulmonary fibrosis in vitro and in vivo and the possible mechanism of actions. It was found that protein expressions of TGFBI were significantly upregulated and G-protein signaling modulator 2 (GPSM2) expression downregulated in fibrotic lung tissues from bleomycin (BLM)-induced rats and TGF-β1-stimulated human lung IMR-90 fibroblasts. Either silencing TGFBI with specific siRNA or treatment with the TGF-β signaling inhibitor SB431542 significantly inhibited TGF-β1-induced fibrotic effects and dysregulation of GPSM2 and Snail expressions in IMR-90 fibroblasts. Moreover, GPSM2 overexpression also inhibited TGF-β1-induced fibrotic effects and Snail upregulation in IMR-90 fibroblasts. Silencing Snail with specific siRNA attenuated TGF-β1-induced fibrotic effects. Therefore, our findings suggest that the extracellular matrix protein TGFBI mediates pulmonary fibrosis through regulation of the GPSM2/Snail axis, which identifies TGFBI as a novel mediator of pulmonary fibrosis and may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.},

	abstract = {Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP) is a lung inflammatory disorder caused by inhalation of organic particles by a susceptible host. However, only a small proportion of individuals exposed to HP-associated antigens develop the disease, suggesting that additional host/environmental factors may play a role. We have previously found that genetic susceptibility associated to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays an important role in this disease. The low molecular weight proteosome (LMP, currently named PSMB) genes code for subunits of the proteosome, a multimeric enzymatic complex that degrades proteins into peptides in order to be presented in the MHC class I pathway. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in PSMB8 or PSMB9 genes could be involved in the susceptibility to HP. Thus, in this study we analyzed the polymorphic site at amino acid position 60 (Arg/His) of the fourth exon in the PSMB9 gene and the amino acid position 49 (Gln/Lys) in the second exon of PSMB8 gene in 50 Mexican patients with HP and 50 healthy ethnically matched controls. PSMB typing was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP). Our results demonstrated that HP patients had a significant increase of the PSMB8 KQ genotype frequency (OR = 7.25, CI = 2.61-21.3; p = 0.000034). No differences were found in the distribution of PSMB9 alleles/genotypes. However, PSMB9-RH/PSMB8 KQ haplotype was significantly increased in HP patients (OR = 6.77, CI = 1.34-65.31, p {\textless} 0.02). These findings suggest that PSMB8 KQ genotype could increase the risk to develop hypersensitivity pneumonitis.},

	abstract = {Fibrosis is a characteristic feature in the pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of diseases. Recently, it was suggested that IL-13-dependent fibrosis develops through a TGF-β1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9-dependent (MMP-9) mechanism. However, the significance of this pathway in a natural disorder of fibrosis was not investigated. In this study, we examined the role of TGF-β in IL-13-dependent liver fibrosis caused by Schistosoma mansoni infection. Infected IL-13−/− mice showed an almost complete abrogation of fibrosis despite continued and undiminished production of TGF-β1. Although MMP-9 activity was implicated in the IL-13 pathway, MMP-9−/− mice displayed no reduction in fibrosis, even when chronically infected. To directly test the requirement for TGF-β, studies were also performed with neutralizing anti-TGF-β Abs, soluble antagonists (soluble TGF-βR-Fc), and Tg mice (Smad3−/− and TGF-βRII-Fc Tg) that have disruptions in all or part of the TGF-β signaling cascade. In all cases, fibrosis developed normally and with kinetics similar to wild-type mice. Production of IL-13 was also unaffected. Finally, several genes, including interstitial collagens, several MMPs, and tissue inhibitors of metalloprotease-1 were up-regulated in TGF-β1−/− mice by IL-13, demonstrating that IL-13 activates the fibrogenic machinery directly. Together, these studies provide unequivocal evidence of a pathway of fibrogenesis that is IL-13 dependent but TGF-β1 independent, illustrating the importance of targeting IL-13 directly in the treatment of infection-induced fibrosis.},

The results showed that glycosaminoglycan deposition in the lesions of ARDS, BOOP, and IPF corresponded to the deposition of versican. Versican localized to the thickened interstitium in the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS, to the intraluminal buds in BOOP, and to early fibroblast foci in IPF. The versican-rich areas contained little mature collagen, but the myofibroblasts in these areas stained for type I procollagen, suggesting early collagen synthesis, and stained intracellularly for decorin. The localization of versican in ARDS, BOOP, and IPF suggests that this proteoglycan may influence early repair processes in the lung.},

In most cells, oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines are stimuli that lead to elevated production of immunoproteasomes. Immune system cells, especially antigen-presenting cells, express a higher basal level of immunoproteasomes. A well-described function of immunoprotea-somes is to generate peptides with a hydrophobic C terminus that can be processed to fit in the groove of MHC class I molecules. This display of peptides on the cell surface allows surveillance by CD8 T cells of the adaptive immune system for pathogen-infected cells. Functions of immunoprotea-somes, other than generating peptides for antigen presentation, are emerging from studies in immunoproteasome-deficient mice, and are complemented by recently described diseases linked to mutations or single-nucleotide polymorphisms in immunoproteasome subunits. Thus, this growing body of literature suggests a more pleiotropic role in cell function for the immunoproteasome.},

The heterogeneity of disease progression in patients with IPF poses significant obstacles to patient care and prevents efficient development of novel therapeutic interventions. Blood biomarkers, reflecting pathobiological processes in the lung, could provide objective evidence of the underlying disease. Longitudinally collected serum samples from the Bosentan Use in Interstitial Lung Disease (BUILD)-3 trial were used to measure four biomarkers (metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), Fas death receptor ligand, osteopontin and procollagen type I C-peptide), to assess their potential prognostic capabilities and to follow changes during disease progression in patients with IPF. In baseline BUILD-3 samples, only MMP-7 showed clearly elevated protein levels compared with samples from healthy controls, and further investigations demonstrated that MMP-7 levels also increased over time. Baseline levels of MMP-7 were able to predict patients who had higher risk of worsening and, notably, baseline levels of MMP-7 could predict changes in FVC as early as month 4. MMP-7 shows potential to be a reliable predictor of lung function decline and disease progression.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and devastating lung disorder of unknown origin, with very poor prognosis and no effective treatment. The disease is characterized by abnormal activation of alveolar epithelial cells, which secrete numerous mediators involved in the expansion of the fibroblast population, its differentiation to myofibroblasts, and in the exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix provoking the loss of lung architecture. Among the excessively produced mediators are several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which may contribute to modify the lung microenvironment by various mechanisms. Thus, these enzymes can not only degrade all the components of the extracellular matrix, but they are also able to release, cleave and activate a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors affecting numerous cell functions including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, recruiting and transmigration, and apoptosis. Therefore, dysregulated expression of MMPs may have profound impact on the biopathological mechanisms implicated in the development of IPF. This review focuses on the current and emerging evidence regarding the role of MMPs on the fibrotic processes in IPF as well as in mouse models of lung fibrosis.},

The purpose of this study was to assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with PF-ILD in a single-center cohort.Methods: Patients with PF-ILD treated in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital from Jan. 2013 to Dec. 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected for survival analysis to identifying clinical predictors of mortality.Results: Among 608 patients with ILD, 132 patients met the diagnostic criteria for PF-ILD. In this single-center cohort, there were 51 (38.6\%) cases with connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) and 45 (34.1\%) with unclassifiable ILDs. During follow-up, 83 patients (62.9\%) either died (N = 79, 59.8\%) or underwent lung transplantations (N = 4, 3.0\%) with a median duration follow-up time of 53.7 months. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that the 1, 3 and 5-years survival of PF-ILD were 90.9, 58.8 and 48.1\%, respectively. In addition, the prognosis of patients with PF-ILD was similar to those with IPF, while it was worse than non-PF-ILD ones. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scores (HR 1.684, 95\% CI 1.017–2.788, p = 0.043) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) {\textgreater} 36.5 mmHg (HR 3.619, 95\%CI 1.170–11.194, p = 0.026) were independent risk factors for the mortality of PF-ILD.Conclusion: Extent of fibrotic changes on HRCT and pulmonary hypertension were predictors of mortality in patients with PF-ILD.},

Unclassifiable ILD patients were identified from an ongoing longitudinal cohort. Unclassifiable ILD was diagnosed after a multidisciplinary review did not secure a specific ILD diagnosis. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-IPF ILDs. Independent predictors of mortality were determined using Cox proportional-hazards analysis to identify subgroups with distinct disease behaviour.
Unclassifiable ILD was diagnosed in 10\% of the ILD cohort (132 out of 1370 patients). The most common reason for being unclassifiable was missing histopathological assessment due to a high risk of surgical lung biopsy. Demographic and physiological features of unclassifiable ILD were intermediate between IPF and non-IPF disease controls. Unclassifiable ILD had longer survival rates when compared to IPF on adjusted analysis (hazard ratio 0.62, p = 0.04) and similar survival compared to non-IPF ILDs (hazard ratio 1.54, p = 0.12). Independent predictors of survival in unclassifiable ILD included diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (p = 0.001) and a radiological fibrosis score (p = 0.02).
Unclassifiable ILD represents approximately 10\% of ILD cases and has a heterogeneous clinical course, which can be predicted using clinical and radiological variables.

However, effects of altered Th1/Th2 commitment on lung senescence are largely unknown. To examine effects of altered Th1/Th2 balance on lung aging, we measured proportions of Th1 and Th2 cells and expression of cytokines, chemokines, collagen deposition and other relevant physiological and pathological parameters in 2- and 20-months-old (mo) CXCR3-deficient (CXCR3−/−) C57BL/6J mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. There was a significant weight-loss observed in 20-mo CXCR3−/− mice compared with the same aged WT group. Although lung function and structure changed with age in both groups, central airway resistance (Rn), tissue elastance (H) and damping (G) were significantly lower in 20-mo CXCR3−/− mice than those of WT mice. In contrast, the whole lung volume (VL), the mean linear intercept length of alveolar (Lm), and the total lung collagen content were significantly elevated in 20-mo CXCR3−/− mice. With aging, the lungs of WT mice had typical Th1-type status (increased population of Th1 cells and concentrations of cytokine IFN-γ and CXCR3 ligands) while CXCR3−/− mice showed Th2-type polarization (decreased proportion of Th1 cells and concentrations of CXCR3 ligands but increased level of IL-4). Our data suggest that Immunosenescence is associated with lung aging, and that altered Th1/Th2 imbalance favors Th2 predominance in CXCR3−/− mice, which contributes to the process of accelerated lung aging in this model.},

	abstract = {Background
Chronic fibrosing idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) is characterized by alveolar epithelial damage, activation of fibroblast proliferation, and loss of normal pulmonary architecture and function. This study aims to investigate the genetic backgrounds of IIP through gene expression profiling and pathway analysis, and to identify potential biomarkers that can aid in diagnosis and serve as novel therapeutic targets.

Methods
RNA extracted from lung specimens of 12 patients with chronic fibrosing IIP was profiled using Illumina Human WG-6 v3 BeadChips, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was performed to identify altered functional and canonical signaling pathways. For validating the results from gene expression analysis, immunohistochemical staining of 10 patients with chronic fibrosing IIP was performed.

Results
Ninety-eight genes were upregulated in IIP patients relative to control subjects. Some of the upregulated genes, namely desmoglein 3 (DSG3), protocadherin gamma-A9 (PCDHGA9) and discoidin domain-containing receptor 1 (DDR1) are implicated in cell-cell interaction and/or adhesion; some, namely collagen type VII, alpha 1 (COL7A1), contactin-associated protein-like 3B (CNTNAP3B) and mucin-1 (MUC1) are encoding the extracellular matrix molecule or the molecules involved in cell-matrix interactions; and the others, namely CDC25C and growth factor independent protein 1B (GFI1B) are known to affect cell proliferation by affecting the progression of cell cycle or regulating transcription. According to pathway analysis, alternated pathways in IIP were related to cell death and survival and cellular growth and proliferation, which are more similar to cancer than to inflammatory response and immunological diseases. Using immunohistochemistry, we further validate that DSG3, the most highly upregulated gene, shows higher expression in chronic fibrosing IIP lung as compared to control lung.

Conclusion
We identified several genes upregulated in chronic fibrosing IIP patients as compared to control, and found genes and pathways implicated in cancer, rather than in inflammatory or immunological disease to play important roles in the pathogenesis of IIPs. Moreover, DSG3 is a novel potential biomarker for chronic fibrosing IIP with its significantly high expression in IIP lung.},

One case of NSIP was also identified and included for comparison. Surgical biopsies from 15 of the 20 UIP cases were diagnosed as UIP, whereas 5 showed only nondiagnostic changes. An important new observation is that areas resembling nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP-like areas) are present in the majority of UIP cases in both biopsy and explant specimens, and they are extensive in some. Ten of the 15 UIP biopsies were considered straightforward, with typical patchy interstitial fibrosis, honeycomb change, and fibroblast foci. Five cases were considered difficult because of prominent NSIP-like areas in two, extensive honeycomb change in one, superimposed diffuse alveolar damage in one, and superimposed bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia in one. The most helpful feature for diagnosing UIP in difficult cases was the presence of a distinct patchwork appearance to the characteristic uneven or variegated parenchymal involvement along with evidence of architectural derangement. No explant showing UIP was preceded by biopsy findings of NSIP, and the one NSIP case appeared similar at biopsy and explant. NSIP or NSIP-like areas and UIP may reflect different mechanisms of fibrosis related either to different severity of injury or to different injuries.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 48 patients (28 men, 20 women; mean age, 57.5 years) with biopsy-proved NSIP (n = 23) or IPF (n = 25) who underwent CT at initial diagnosis and at follow-up 34-155 months later. The CT scans were randomized and reviewed by two independent thoracic radiologists for pattern and distribution of ground-glass opacity (GGO), reticulation, traction bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis, and honeycombing. Statistical analysis was performed by using nonparametric methods and univariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Follow-up CT in patients with NSIP showed marked decrease in the extent of GGO, increase in reticulation, and a greater likelihood of peripheral distribution (all P {\textless} .05). At presentation, the CT findings were interpreted as suggestive of NSIP in 18 of 23 patients with NSIP and indeterminate or suggestive of IPF in five. In five (28\%) of 18 patients with initial findings suggestive of NSIP, the follow-up CT scans were interpreted as more suggestive of IPF. No CT features seen at presentation allowed distinction between patients with NSIP that maintained an NSIP pattern at follow-up and those that progressed to an IPF pattern.
CONCLUSION: At follow-up CT, 28\% of patients with initial CT findings suggestive of NSIP progressed to findings suggestive of IPF. Similar initial CT findings for NSIP may have different imaging outcomes.},

We conducted a joint analysis of differential expression and differential splicing on annotated human genes and isoforms, and identified 122 non-differentially expressed genes with a high degree of “switch” between major and minor isoforms. Three cases with variant mechanisms for alternative splicing were validated using qRT-PCR, among the group of genes in which expression was not significantly changed at the gene level. We also identified 35 novel transcripts that were unique to the fibrotic lungs using exon-exon junction evidence, and selected a representative for qRT-PCR validation.

	abstract = {Rationale: Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP) is caused by an immune response to antigen inhalation and is characterized by variable histopathological and clinical features. A subset of subjects with CHP have usual interstitial pneumonia and appear to be clinically similar to subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Objectives: To determine the common and unique molecular features of CHP and IPF.

Methods: Transcriptome analysis of lung samples from CHP (n = 82), IPF (n = 103), and unaffected controls (n = 103) was conducted. Differential gene expression was determined adjusting for sex, race, age, and smoking history and using false discovery rate to control for multiple comparisons.

Measurements and Main Results: When compared with controls, we identified 413 upregulated and 317 downregulated genes in CHP and 861 upregulated and 322 downregulated genes in IPF. Concordantly upregulated or downregulated genes in CHP and IPF were related to collagen catabolic processes and epithelial development, whereas genes specific to CHP (differentially expressed in CHP when compared with control and not differentially expressed in IPF) were related to chemokine-mediated signaling and immune responsiveness. Using weighted gene coexpression network analysis, we found that among subjects with CHP, genes involved in adaptive immunity or epithelial cell development were associated with improved or reduced lung function, respectively, and that MUC5B expression was associated with epithelial cell development. MUC5B expression was also associated with lung fibrosis and honeycombing.

Conclusions: Gene expression analysis of CHP and IPF identified signatures common to CHP and IPF, as well as genes uniquely expressed in CHP. Select modules of gene expression are characterized by distinct clinical and pathological features of CHP.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism, which often occurs in response to environmental stimuli and is crucial in regulating gene expression. It is likely that epigenetic alterations contribute to pathogenesis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
OBJECTIVES: To determine the DNA methylation changes in IPF and their effects on gene expression.
METHODS: Total DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferase expression were compared in IPF and normal control lung tissues. IPF and normal tissues were subjected to comparative analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA expression using DNA hybridization to the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip and RNA hybridization to Illumina HumanHT-12 BeadChip. Functional analyses of differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes were done. Selected genes were validated at DNA, RNA, and protein levels.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: DNA methylation status was altered in IPF. IPF samples demonstrated higher DNA methyltransferase expression without observed alterations in global DNA methylation. Genome-wide differences in DNA methylation status and RNA expression were demonstrated by array hybridization. Among the genes whose DNA methylation status and RNA expression were both significantly altered, 16 genes were hypermethylated in DNA associated with decreased mRNA expression or vice versa. We validated CLDN5, ZNF467, TP53INP1, and DDAH1 genes at the level of DNA methylation status, RNA, and protein-level expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in DNA methylation correspond to altered mRNA expression of a number of genes, some with known and others with previously uncharacterized roles in IPF, suggesting that DNA methylation is important in the pathogenesis of IPF.},

Here we demonstrate elevated abundance of senescence biomarkers in IPF lung, with p16 expression increasing with disease severity. We show that the secretome of senescent fibroblasts, which are selectively killed by a senolytic cocktail, dasatinib plus quercetin (DQ), is fibrogenic. Leveraging the bleomycin-injury IPF model, we demonstrate that early-intervention suicide-gene-mediated senescent cell ablation improves pulmonary function and physical health, although lung fibrosis is visibly unaltered.

	abstract = {Background
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal lung disease of unknown etiology. A major limitation in transcriptomic profiling of lung tissue in IPF has been a dependence on snap-frozen fresh tissues (FF). In this project we sought to determine whether genome scale transcript profiling using RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) could be applied to archived Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) IPF tissues.

Results
We isolated total RNA from 7 IPF and 5 control FFPE lung tissues and performed 50 base pair paired-end sequencing on Illumina 2000 HiSeq. TopHat2 was used to map sequencing reads to the human genome. On average {\textasciitilde}62 million reads (53.4\% of {\textasciitilde}116 million reads) were mapped per sample. 4,131 genes were differentially expressed between IPF and controls (1,920 increased and 2,211 decreased (FDR {\textless} 0.05). We compared our results to differentially expressed genes calculated from a previously published dataset generated from FF tissues analyzed on Agilent microarrays (GSE47460). The overlap of differentially expressed genes was very high (760 increased and 1,413 decreased, FDR {\textless} 0.05). Only 92 differentially expressed genes changed in opposite directions. Pathway enrichment analysis performed using MetaCore confirmed numerous IPF relevant genes and pathways including extracellular remodeling, TGF-beta, and WNT. Gene network analysis of MMP7, a highly differentially expressed gene in both datasets, revealed the same canonical pathways and gene network candidates in RNA-Seq and microarray data. For validation by NanoString nCounter® we selected 35 genes that had a fold change of 2 in at least one dataset (10 discordant, 10 significantly differentially expressed in one dataset only and 15 concordant genes). High concordance of fold change and FDR was observed for each type of the samples (FF vs FFPE) with both microarrays (r = 0.92) and RNA-Seq (r = 0.90) and the number of discordant genes was reduced to four.

Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that RNA sequencing of RNA obtained from archived FFPE lung tissues is feasible. The results obtained from FFPE tissue are highly comparable to FF tissues. The ability to perform RNA-Seq on archived FFPE IPF tissues should greatly enhance the availability of tissue biopsies for research in IPF.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an untreatable lung disease with a median survival of only 3-5 years that is diagnosed using a combination of clinical, radiographic and pathologic criteria. Histologically, IPF is characterised by usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), a fibrosing interstitial pneumonia with a pattern of heterogeneous, subpleural regions of fibrotic and remodelled lung. We hypothesised that gene expression profiles of lung tissue may identify molecular subtypes of disease that could classify subtypes of IPF/UIP that have clinical implications.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected transcriptional profiles on lung tissue from 119 patients with IPF/UIP and 50 non-diseased controls. Differential expression of individual transcripts was identified using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model incorporating the clinical diagnosis of each patient as well as age, gender and smoking status. Validation was performed in an independent cohort of 111 IPF/UIP and 39 non-diseased controls. Our analysis identified two subtypes of IPF/UIP based on a strong molecular signature associated with expression of genes previously associated with fibrosis (matrix metalloproteinases, osteopontin, keratins), cilium genes and genes with unknown function. We demonstrate that elevated expression of cilium genes is associated with more extensive microscopic honeycombing and higher expression of both the airway mucin gene MUC5B and the metalloproteinase MMP7, a gene recently implicated in attenuating ciliated cell differentiation during wound repair.
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of cilium genes appears to identify two unique molecular phenotypes of IPF/UIP. The different molecular profiles may be relevant to therapeutic responsiveness in patients with IPF/UIP.},

	abstract = {There are limited epidemiologic studies describing the global burden and geographic heterogeneity of interstitial lung disease (ILD) subtypes. We found that among seventeen methodologically heterogenous studies that examined the incidence, prevalence and relative frequencies of ILDs, the incidence of ILD ranged from 1 to 31.5 per 100,000 person-years and prevalence ranged from 6.3 to 71 per 100,000 people. In North America and Europe, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis were the most prevalent ILDs while the relative frequency of hypersensitivity pneumonitis was higher in Asia, particularly in India (10.7–47.3\%) and Pakistan (12.6\%). The relative frequency of connective tissue disease ILD demonstrated the greatest geographic variability, ranging from 7.5\% of cases in Belgium to 33.3\% of cases in Canada and 34.8\% of cases in Saudi Arabia. These differences may represent true differences based on underlying characteristics of the source populations or methodological differences in disease classification and patient recruitment (registry vs. population-based cohorts). There are three areas where we feel addition work is needed to better understand the global burden of ILD. First, a standard ontology with diagnostic confidence thresholds for comparative epidemiology studies of ILD is needed. Second, more globally representative data should be published in English language journals as current literature has largely focused on Europe and North America with little data from South America, Africa and Asia. Third, the inclusion of community-based cohorts that leverage the strength of large databases can help better estimate population burden of disease. These large, community-based longitudinal cohorts would also allow for tracking of global trends and be a valuable resource for collective study. We believe the ILD research community should organize to define a shared ontology for disease classification and commit to conducting global claims and electronic health record based epidemiologic studies in a standardized fashion. Aggregating and sharing this type of data would provide a unique opportunity for international collaboration as our understanding of ILD continues to grow and evolve. Better understanding the geographic and temporal patterns of disease prevalence and identifying clusters of ILD subtypes will facilitate improved understanding of emerging risk factors and help identify targets for future intervention.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal fibrotic lung disease characterized by aberrant remodeling of the lung parenchyma with extensive changes to the phenotypes of all lung resident cells. The introduction of transcriptomics, genome scale profiling of thousands of RNA transcripts, caused a significant inversion in IPF research. Instead of generating hypotheses based on animal models of disease, or biological plausibility, with limited validation in humans, investigators were able to generate hypotheses based on unbiased molecular analysis of human samples and then use animal models of disease to test their hypotheses. In this review, we describe the insights made from transcriptomic analysis of human IPF samples. We describe how transcriptomic studies led to identification of novel genes and pathways involved in the human IPF lung such as: matrix metalloproteinases, WNT pathway, epithelial genes, role of microRNAs among others, as well as conceptual insights such as the involvement of developmental pathways and deep shifts in epithelial and fibroblast phenotypes. The impact of lung and transcriptomic studies on disease classification, endotype discovery, and reproducible biomarkers is also described in detail. Despite these impressive achievements, the impact of transcriptomic studies has been limited because they analyzed bulk tissue and did not address the cellular and spatial heterogeneity of the IPF lung. We discuss new emerging technologies and applications, such as single-cell RNAseq and microenvironment analysis that may address cellular and spatial heterogeneity. We end by making the point that most current tissue collections and resources are not amenable to analysis using the novel technologies. To take advantage of the new opportunities, we need new efforts of sample collections, this time focused on access to all the microenvironments and cells in the IPF lung.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Many of the interstitial lung diseases represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge because their clinical and even histologic features are often nonspecific. Likewise, the transcriptional signatures of most of them are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the gene expression patterns from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) using custom oligonucleotide microarrays.
METHODS: We profiled lung biopsies from 15 patients with IPF, 12 with HP, and eight with NSIP. Labeled complementary ribonucleic acid was hybridized to a custom Affymetrix oligonucleotide DNA microarray using standard Affymetrix protocols. The custom array, Hu03, contained 59,619 probe sets representing an estimated 46,000 gene clusters.
RESULTS: We identified statistically significant gene expression signatures that characterize HP and IPF. The HP gene expression signature was enriched for genes that are functionally associated with inflammation, T-cell activation, and immune responses, whereas the IPF signature was characterized by the expression of tissue remodeling, epithelial, and myofibroblast genes. We then compared these gene expression signatures to classify NSIP, a histologic pattern that is often difficult to differentiate consistently from HP and IPF. Two cases exhibited an IPF-like gene expression, another one could be more properly classified as HP, whereas others did not resemble HP or IPF, suggesting that they may represent idiopathic NSIP.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the value of gene expression signatures to classify the interstitial lung diseases and to understand pathogenic mechanisms, and suggest new ways to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with these diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive fibrotic lung disease that distorts pulmonary architecture, leading to hypoxia, respiratory failure, and death. Diagnosis is difficult because other interstitial lung diseases have similar radiological and histopathological characteristics. A usual interstitial pneumonia pattern is a hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and is essential for its diagnosis. We aimed to develop a molecular test that distinguishes usual interstitial pneumonia from other interstitial lung diseases in surgical lung biopsy samples. The eventual goal of this research is to develop a method to diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis without the patient having to undergo surgery.
METHODS: We collected surgical lung biopsy samples from patients with various interstitial lung diseases at 11 hospitals in North America. Pathology diagnoses were confirmed by an expert panel. We measured RNA expression levels for 33 297 transcripts on microarrays in all samples. A classifier algorithm was trained on one set of samples and tested in a second set. We subjected a subset of samples to next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) generating expression levels on 55 097 transcripts, and assessed a classifier trained on RNAseq data by cross-validation.
FINDINGS: We took 125 surgical lung biopsies from 86 patients. 58 samples were identified by the expert panel as usual interstitial pneumonia, 23 as non-specific interstitial pneumonia, 16 as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, four as sarcoidosis, four as respiratory bronchiolitis, two as organising pneumonia, and 18 as subtypes other than usual interstitial pneumonia. The microarray classifier was trained on 77 samples and was assessed in a test set of 48 samples, for which it had a specificity of 92\% (95\% CI 81-100) and a sensitivity of 82\% (64-95). Based on a subset of 36 samples, the RNAseq classifier had a specificity of 95\% (84-100) and a sensitivity of 59\% (35-82).
INTERPRETATION: Our results show that the development of a genomic signature that predicts usual interstitial pneumonia is feasible. These findings are an important first step towards the development of a molecular test that could be applied to bronchoscopy samples, thus avoiding surgery in the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

	abstract = {Background
Clinical guidelines specify that diagnosis of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) requires identification of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern. While UIP can be identified by high resolution CT of the chest, the results are often inconclusive, making surgical lung biopsy necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis (Raghu et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med 183(6):788–824, 2011). The Envisia genomic classifier differentiates UIP from non-UIP pathology in transbronchial biopsies (TBB), potentially allowing patients to avoid an invasive procedure (Brown et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med 195:A6792, 2017). To ensure patient safety and efficacy, a laboratory developed test (LDT) must meet strict regulatory requirements for accuracy, reproducibility and robustness. The analytical characteristics of the Envisia test are assessed and reported here.

Methods
The Envisia test utilizes total RNA extracted from TBB samples to perform Next Generation RNA Sequencing. The gene count data from 190 genes are then input to the Envisia genomic classifier, a machine learning algorithm, to output either a UIP or non-UIP classification result. We characterized the stability of RNA in TBBs during collection and shipment, and evaluated input RNA mass and proportions on the limit of detection of UIP. We evaluated potentially interfering substances such as blood and genomic DNA. Intra-run, inter-run, and inter-laboratory reproducibility of test results were also characterized.

Results
RNA content within TBBs preserved in RNAprotect is stable for up to 14 days with no detectable change in RNA quality. The Envisia test is tolerant to variation in RNA input (5 to 30 ng), with no impact on classifier results. The Envisia test can tolerate dilution of non-UIP and UIP classification signals at the RNA level by up to 60\% and 20\%, respectively. Analytical specificity studies utilizing UIP and non-UIP samples mixed with genomic DNA (up to 30\% relative input) demonstrated no impact to classifier results. The Envisia test tolerates up to 22\% of blood contamination, well beyond the level observed in TBBs. The test is reproducible from RNA extraction through to Envisia test result (standard deviation of 0.20 for Envisia classification scores on {\textgreater} 7-unit scale).

Conclusions
The Envisia test demonstrates the robust analytical performance required of an LDT. Envisia can be used to inform the diagnoses of patients with suspected IPF.

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) characterized by abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We hypothesized that ECM remodeling might result in a plasma profile of proteins specific for IPF that could distinguish patients with IPF from other idiopathic ILDs.
OBJECTIVES: To identify biomarkers that might assist in distinguishing IPF from non-IPF ILD.
METHODS: We developed a panel of 35 ECM, ECM-related, and lung-specific analytes measured in plasma from 86 patients with IPF (derivation cohort) and in 63 patients with IPF (validation cohort). Comparison groups included patients with rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD (RA-ILD; n = 33), patients with alternative idiopathic ILDs (a-ILD; n = 41), and healthy control subjects (n = 127). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models identified biomarkers that differentiated patients with IPF from those with a-ILD. Both continuous and diagnostic threshold versions of biomarkers were considered; thresholds were chosen to maximize summed diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in univariate receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. A diagnostic score was created from the most promising analytes.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Plasma surfactant protein (SP)-D {\textgreater} 31 ng/ml, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 {\textgreater} 1.75 ng/ml, and osteopontin {\textgreater} 6 ng/ml each significantly distinguished patients with IPF from patients with a-ILD, both individually and in a combined index. The odds ratio for IPF when at least one analyte in the index exceeded the threshold was 4.4 (95\% confidence interval, 2.0-9.7; P = 0.0003). When at least two analytes were elevated, the odds ratio for IPF increased to 5.0 (95\% confidence interval, 2.2-11.5; P = 0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: A biomarker index of SP-D, MMP-7, and osteopontin enhanced diagnostic accuracy in patients with IPF compared with those with non-IPF ILD. Our data suggest that this biomarker index may improve diagnostic confidence in IPF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood-derived biomarkers have been described extensively as potential prognostic markers in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but studies have been limited by analyses using data-dependent thresholds, inconsistent adjustment for confounders and an array of end-points, thus often yielding ungeneralisable results. Meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) is a powerful tool to overcome these limitations. Through systematic review of blood-derived biomarkers, sufficient studies with measurements of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 were identified to facilitate standardised analyses of the prognostic potential of this biomarker in IPF.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched on 12 November 2020 to identify prospective studies reporting outcomes in patients with untreated IPF, stratified according to at least one pre-specified biomarker, measured at either baseline, or change over 3 months. IPD were sought for studies investigating MMP-7 as a prognostic factor. The primary outcome was overall mortality according to standardised MMP-7 z-scores, with a secondary outcome of disease progression in 12 months, all adjusted for age, gender, smoking and baseline forced vital capacity.
RESULTS: IPD was available for nine studies out of 12 identified, reporting outcomes from 1664 participants. Baseline MMP-7 levels were associated with increased mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio 1.23, 95\% CI 1.03-1.48; I2=64.3\%) and disease progression (adjusted OR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.11-1.46; I2=5.9\%). In limited studies, 3-month change in MMP-7 was not associated with outcomes.
CONCLUSION: IPD meta-analysis demonstrated that greater baseline MMP-7 levels were independently associated with an increased risk of poor outcomes in patients with untreated IPF, while short-term changes did not reflect disease progression.},

Performance was evaluated by cross-validation and on an independent test set of specimens from 31 subjects. We explored the feasibility of a single molecular test per subject by combining multiple TBBs from upper and lower lobes. To address whether classifier accuracy depends upon adequate alveolar sampling, we tested for correlation between classifier accuracy and expression of alveolar-specific genes.
RESULTS: The top-performing algorithm distinguishes UIP from non-UIP conditions in single TBB samples with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86, with specificity of 86\% (confidence interval = 71-95\%) and sensitivity of 63\% (confidence interval = 51-74\%) (31 test subjects). Performance improves to an AUC of 0.92 when three to five TBB samples per subject are combined at the RNA level for testing. Although we observed a wide range of type I and II alveolar-specific gene expression in TBBs, expression of these transcripts did not correlate with classifier accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate proof of principle that genomic analysis and machine learning improves the utility of TBB for the diagnosis of UIP, with greater sensitivity and specificity than pathology in TBB alone. Combining multiple individual subject samples results in increased test accuracy over single sample testing. This approach requires validation in an independent cohort of subjects before application in the clinic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both the validity and the reproducibility of microarray-based clinical research have been challenged. There is a need for critical review of the statistical analysis and reporting in published microarray studies that focus on cancer-related clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Studies published through 2004 in which microarray-based gene expression profiles were analyzed for their relation to a clinical cancer outcome were identified through a Medline search followed by hand screening of abstracts and full text articles. Studies that were eligible for our analysis addressed one or more outcomes that were either an event occurring during follow-up, such as death or relapse, or a therapeutic response. We recorded descriptive characteristics for all the selected studies. A critical review of outcome-related statistical analyses was undertaken for the articles published in 2004.
RESULTS: Ninety studies were identified, and their descriptive characteristics are presented. Sixty-eight (76\%) were published in journals of impact factor greater than 6. A detailed account of the 42 studies (47\%) published in 2004 is reported. Twenty-one (50\%) of them contained at least one of the following three basic flaws: 1) in outcome-related gene finding, an unstated, unclear, or inadequate control for multiple testing; 2) in class discovery, a spurious claim of correlation between clusters and clinical outcome, made after clustering samples using a selection of outcome-related differentially expressed genes; or 3) in supervised prediction, a biased estimation of the prediction accuracy through an incorrect cross-validation procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: The most common and serious mistakes and misunderstandings recorded in published studies are described and illustrated. Based on this analysis, a proposal of guidelines for statistical analysis and reporting for clinical microarray studies, presented as a checklist of "Do's and Don'ts," is provided.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The continued progress in developing technological platforms, availability of many published experimental datasets, as well as different statistical methods to analyze those data have allowed approaching the same research question using various methods simultaneously. To get the best out of all these alternatives, we need to integrate their results in an unbiased manner. Prioritized gene lists are a common result presentation method in genomic data analysis applications. Thus, the rank aggregation methods can become a useful and general solution for the integration task., Results: Standard rank aggregation methods are often ill-suited for biological settings where the gene lists are inherently noisy. As a remedy, we propose a novel robust rank aggregation (RRA) method. Our method detects genes that are ranked consistently better than expected under null hypothesis of uncorrelated inputs and assigns a significance score for each gene. The underlying probabilistic model makes the algorithm parameter free and robust to outliers, noise and errors. Significance scores also provide a rigorous way to keep only the statistically relevant genes in the final list. These properties make our approach robust and compelling for many settings., Availability: All the methods are implemented as a GNU R package RobustRankAggreg, freely available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network http://cran.r-project.org/., Contact:

However, the results of such studies are often inconsistent, mostly due to the lack of cross-platform standardization, ongoing discovery of novel miRNAs, and small sample size. Therefore, a critical and systematic analysis of all available information is essential for successful identification of the most relevant miRNAs. Meta-analysis approach allows integrating the results from several independent studies in order to achieve greater statistical power and estimate the variability between the studies. Here we describe as an example the use of a robust rank aggregation (RRA) method for identification of miRNA meta-signature in lung cancer. This method analyzes prioritized gene lists and finds commonly overlapping genes, which are ranked consistently better than expected by chance. An RRA approach not only helps to prioritize the putative targets for further experimental studies but also highlights the challenges related with the development of miRNA-based tests and emphasizes the need for rigorous evaluation of the results before proceeding to clinical trials.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNA (miRNA) control key elements of mRNA stability and likely contribute to the dysregulated lung gene expression observed in systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). We analyzed the miRNA gene expression of tissue and cells from patients with SSc-ILD. A chronic lung fibrotic murine model was used.
METHODS: RNA was isolated from lung tissue of 12 patients with SSc-ILD and 5 controls. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed at baseline and 2-3 years after treatment. Lung fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy controls and patients with SSc-ILD. miRNA and mRNA were analyzed by microarray, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and/or Nanostring; pathway analysis was performed by DNA Intelligent Analysis (DIANA)-miRPath v2.0 software. Wild-type and miR-155 deficient (miR-155ko) mice were exposed to bleomycin.
RESULTS: Lung miRNA microarray data distinguished patients with SSc-ILD from healthy controls with 185 miRNA differentially expressed (q {\textless} 0.25). DIANA-miRPath revealed 57 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways related to the most dysregulated miRNA. miR-155 and miR-143 were strongly correlated with progression of the HRCT score. Lung fibroblasts only mildly expressed miR-155/miR-21 after several stimuli. miR-155 PBMC expression strongly correlated with lung function tests in SSc-ILD. miR-155ko mice developed milder lung fibrosis, survived longer, and weaker lung induction of several genes after bleomycin exposure compared to wild-type mice.
CONCLUSIONS: miRNA are dysregulated in the lungs and PBMC of patients with SSc-ILD. Based on mRNA-miRNA interaction analysis and pathway tools, miRNA may play a role in the progression of the disease. Our findings suggest that targeting miR-155 might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for SSc-ILD.},

Lung tissues from macroscopically normal-appearing (IPFn) and scarred (IPFs) areas of explanted IPF lungs were analyzed by RNASeq and compared with healthy control (HC) lung tissues. There were profound transcriptomic changes in IPFn compared with HC tissues, which included elevated expression of numerous immune-, inflammation-, and extracellular matrix-related mRNAs, and these changes were similar to those observed with IPFs compared to HC. Comparing IPFn directly to IPFs, elevated expression of epithelial mucociliary mRNAs was observed in the IPFs tissues. Thus, despite the known geographic tissue heterogeneity in IPF, the entire lung is actively involved in the disease process, and demonstrates pronounced elevated expression of numerous immune-related genes. Differences between normal-appearing and scarred tissues may thus be driven by deranged epithelial homeostasis or possibly non-transcriptomic factors.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one of the leading causes of mortality. We undertook this study to analyze the gene expression of lung tissue in a prospective cohort of patients with SSc-related ILD and to compare it with that in control lungs and with 2 prospective clinical parameters in order to understand the molecular pathways implicated in progressive lung disease.
METHODS: Lung tissue was obtained by open lung biopsy in 28 consecutive patients with SSc-related ILD and in 4 controls. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and pulmonary function testing (PFT) were performed at baseline and 2-3 years after treatment based on lung histologic classification. Microarray analysis was performed, and the results were correlated with changes in the HRCT score (FibMax) and PFT values. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to confirm differential levels of messenger RNA and protein.
RESULTS: Lung microarray data distinguished patients with SSc-related ILD from healthy controls. In the lungs of patients with SSc-related ILD who had nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), expressed genes included macrophage markers, chemokines, collagen, and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)- and interferon (IFN)-regulated genes. Expression of these genes correlated with progressive lung fibrosis defined by the change in FibMax. Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased markers of collagen (COL1A1), IFN (OAS1 and IFI44), and macrophages (CCL18 and CD163), and the positive correlation with the change in FibMax was confirmed by qPCR in a larger group of SSc patients with NSIP. Several genes correlated with both the change in FibMax (r {\textgreater} 0.4) and the change in \% predicted forced vital capacity (r {\textless} -0.1), including IFN and macrophage markers, chemokines, and heat-shock proteins.
CONCLUSION: These results highlight major pathogenic pathways relevant to progressive pulmonary fibrosis in SSc-related ILD: macrophage emigration and activation, and up-regulated expression of TGFβ- and IFN-regulated genes.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Peripheral blood biomarkers are needed to identify and determine the extent of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Current physiologic and radiographic prognostic indicators diagnose IPF too late in the course of disease. We hypothesize that peripheral blood biomarkers will identify disease in its early stages, and facilitate monitoring for disease progression.
METHODS: Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood RNA from 130 IPF patients were collected on Agilent microarrays. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1\% was utilized to identify genes that were differentially-expressed in samples categorized based on percent predicted D(L)CO and FVC.
MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: At 1\% FDR, 1428 genes were differentially-expressed in mild IPF (D(L)CO {\textgreater}65\%) compared to controls and 2790 transcripts were differentially- expressed in severe IPF (D(L)CO {\textgreater}35\%) compared to controls. When categorized by percent predicted D(L)CO, SAM demonstrated 13 differentially-expressed transcripts between mild and severe IPF ({\textless} 5\% FDR). These include CAMP, CEACAM6, CTSG, DEFA3 and A4, OLFM4, HLTF, PACSIN1, GABBR1, IGHM, and 3 unknown genes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to determine outliers based on severity of disease, and demonstrated 1 mild case to be clinically misclassified as a severe case of IPF. No differentially-expressed transcripts were identified between mild and severe IPF when categorized by percent predicted FVC.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the peripheral blood transcriptome has the potential to distinguish normal individuals from patients with IPF, as well as extent of disease when samples were classified by percent predicted D(L)CO, but not FVC.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Changes in the respiratory microbiome are associated with disease progression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The role of the host response to the respiratory microbiome remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the host-microbial interactions in IPF.
METHODS: Sixty patients diagnosed with IPF were prospectively enrolled together with 20 matched control subjects. Subjects underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and peripheral whole blood was collected into PAXgene tubes for all subjects at baseline. For subjects with IPF, additional samples were taken at 1, 3, and 6 months and (if alive) 1 year. Gene expression profiles were generated using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST arrays.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: By network analysis of gene expression data, we identified two gene modules that strongly associated with a diagnosis of IPF, BAL bacterial burden (determined by 16S quantitative polymerase chain reaction), and specific microbial operational taxonomic units, as well as with lavage and peripheral blood neutrophilia. Genes within these modules that are involved in the host defense response include NLRC4, PGLYRP1, MMP9, and DEFA4. The modules also contain two genes encoding specific antimicrobial peptides (SLPI and CAMP). Many of these particular transcripts were associated with survival and showed longitudinal overexpression in subjects experiencing disease progression, further strengthening the relationship of the transcripts with disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated analysis of the host transcriptome and microbial signatures demonstrated an apparent host response to the presence of an altered or more abundant microbiome. These responses remained elevated in longitudinal follow-up, suggesting that the bacterial communities of the lower airways may act as persistent stimuli for repetitive alveolar injury in IPF.},

Methods S1P lyase (S1PL) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was correlated with pulmonary functions and overall survival; used a murine model to check the role of S1PL on the fibrogenesis and a cell culture system to study the effect of S1PL expression on transforming growth factor (TGF)-β- and S1P-induced fibroblast differentiation.
Results S1PL expression was upregulated in fibrotic lung tissues and primary lung fibroblasts isolated from patients with IPF and bleomycin-challenged mice. TGF-β increased the expression of S1PL in human lung fibroblasts via activation and binding of Smad3 transcription factor to Sgpl1 promoter. Overexpression of S1PL attenuated TGF-β-induced and S1P-induced differentiation of human lung fibroblasts through regulation of the expression of LC3 and beclin 1. Knockdown of S1PL (Sgpl1+/−) in mice augmented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and patients with IPF reduced Sgpl1 mRNA expression in PBMCs exhibited higher severity of fibrosis and lower survival rate.
Conclusion These studies suggest that S1PL is a novel endogenous suppressor of pulmonary fibrosis in human IPF and animal models.},

	abstract = {The immunome (immune cell phenotype, gene expression, and serum cytokines profiling) in pulmonary fibrosis is incompletely defined. Studies focusing on inherited forms of pulmonary fibrosis provide insights into mechanisms of fibrotic lung disease in general. To define the cellular and molecular immunologic phenotype in peripheral blood, high-dimensional flow cytometry and large-scale gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum proteomic multiplex analyses were performed and compared in a cohort with familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF), an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance; Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome pulmonary fibrosis (HPSPF), a rare autosomal recessive disorder; and their unaffected relatives. Our results showed high peripheral blood concentrations of activated central memory helper cells in patients with FPF. Proportions of CD38+ memory CD27- B-cells, IgA+ memory CD27+ B-cells, IgM+ and IgD+ B-cells, and CD39+ T helper cells were increased whereas those of CD39- T helper cells were reduced in patients affected with either familial or HPSPF. Gene expression and serum proteomic analyses revealed enrichment of upregulated genes associated with mitosis and cell cycle control in circulating mononuclear cells as well as altered levels of several analytes, including leptin, cytokines, and growth factors. In conclusion, dysregulation of the extra-pulmonary immunome is a phenotypic feature of FPF or HPSPF. Further studies investigating the blood immunome are indicated to determine the role of immune system dysregulation in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.

Aberrant gene expression and epigenetic modifications in circulating immune cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SSc. This study is to delineate the interaction network between gene transcription and DNA methylation in PBMC of SSc patients and to identify methylation-regulated genes which are involved in the pathogenesis of SSc. Methods. Genome-wide mRNA transcription and global DNA methylation analysis were performed on PBMC from 18 SSc patients and 19 matched normal controls (NC) using Illumina BeadChips. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were integrative analyzed to identify methylation-regulated genes and associated molecular pathways. Results. Transcriptome analysis distinguished 453 DEGs (269 up- and 184 downregulated) in SSc from NC. Global DNA methylation analysis identified 925 DMPs located on 618 genes. Integration of the two lists revealed only 20 DEGs which harbor inversely correlated DMPs, including 12 upregulated (ELANE, CTSG, LTBR, C3AR1, CSTA, SPI1, ODF3B, SAMD4A, PLAUR, NFE2, ZYX, and CTSZ) and eight downregulated genes (RUNX3, PRF1, PRKCH, PAG1, RASSF5, FYN, CXCR6, and F2R). These potential methylation-regulated DEGs (MeDEGs) are enriched in the pathways related to immune cell migration, proliferation, activation, and inflammation activities. Using a machine learning algorism, we identified six out of the 20 MeDEGs, including F2R, CXCR6, FYN, LTBR, CTSG, and ELANE, which distinguished SSc from NC with 100\% accuracy. Four genes (F2R, FYN, PAG1, and PRKCH) differentially expressed in SSc with interstitial lung disease (ILD) compared to SSc without ILD. Conclusion. The identified MeDEGs may represent novel candidate factors which lead to the abnormal activation of immune regulatory pathways in the pathogenesis of SSc. They may also be used as diagnostic biomarkers for SSc and clinical complications.},

To find and validate generalizable sepsis subtypes using data-driven clustering.

Design
We used advanced informatics techniques to pool data from 14 bacterial sepsis transcriptomic datasets from 8 different countries (N=700).

Setting
Retrospective analysis.

Subjects
Persons admitted to the hospital with bacterial sepsis.

Interventions
None.

Measurements and Main Results
A unified clustering analysis across 14 discovery datasets revealed three subtypes, which, based on functional analysis, we termed Inflammopathic, Adaptive, and Coagulopathic. We then validated these subtypes in 9 independent datasets from 5 different countries (N=600). In both discovery and validation data, the Adaptive subtype is associated with a lower clinical severity and lower mortality rate, and the Coagulopathic subtype is associated with higher mortality and clinical coagulopathy. Further, these clusters are statistically associated with clusters derived by others in independent single sepsis cohorts.

Conclusions
The three sepsis subtypes may represent a unifying framework for understanding the molecular heterogeneity of the sepsis syndrome. Further study could potentially enable a precision-medicine approach of matching novel immunomodulatory therapies with septic patients most likely to benefit.},

In this study, the authors aimed to evaluate the expression of the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in human fibroblasts and whole tissues from IPF and normal lungs. They also determined the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in TIMP3 expression. TIMP1, TIMP2, and TIMP3 were highly expressed in lung fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, a profibrotic mediator, induced strong up-regulation of TIMP3 at the mRNA and protein levels. The authors examined whether the MAPK pathway was involved in TGF-beta1-induced TIMP3 expression. TGF-beta1 induced the phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. Biochemical blockade of p38 by SB203580, but not of the ERK MAPK pathway, inhibited the effect of this factor. The effect was also blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and by antagonizing TGF-beta1 receptor type I (activin-linked kinase [ALK5]). In IPF tissues TIMP3 gene expression was significantly increased and the protein was localized to fibroblastic foci and extracellular matrix. Our findings suggest that TGF-beta1-induced TIMP3 may be an important mediator in lung fibrogenesis.},

We generated Hspa4l−/−Hspa4−/− mice to investigate a functional complementarity between HSPA4L and HSPA4 during embryonic development. Hspa4l−/−Hspa4−/− embryos exhibited marked pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal death. Compared with lungs of wild-type, Hspa4l−/−, and Hspa4−/− embryos, Hspa4l−/−Hspa4−/− lungs were characterized by diminished saccular spaces and increased mesenchymal septa. Mesenchymal hypercellularity was determined to be due to an increased cell proliferation index and decreased cell death. A significant increase in expression levels of prosurvival protein B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 may be the cause for inhibition of apoptotic process in lungs of Hspa4−/−Hspa4l−/− embryos. Accumulation of glycogen and diminished expression of surfactant protein B, prosurfactant protein C, and aquaporin 5 in saccular epithelium suggested impaired maturation of type II and type I pneumocytes in the Hspa4l−/−Hspa4−/− lungs. Further experiments showed a significant accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the lungs of Hspa4l−/−Hspa4−/− embryos, indicating an impaired chaperone activity.

A set of 39 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was found critical to distinguish IPF. Using high confidence evidences and experimental data, system level networks for IPF were reconstructed, involving 737 DEGs found common across at least two independent studies. This all provided one of the most comprehensive molecular system views for IPF underlining the regulatory and molecular consequences associated. 56 pathways crosstalks were identified which included critical pathways with specified directionality. The associated steps gained and lost due to crosstalk during IPF were also identified. A serially connected system of five crucial genes was found, potentially controlled by nine miRNAs and eight transcription factors exclusively in IPF when compared to NSIP and Sarcoidosis.

BACKGROUND: Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP) is an interstitial lung disease caused by hypersensitive reactions to inhaled antigens. Clinically, the task of differentiating CHP and other interstitial lung diseases, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), was challenging.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analyzed the publically available gene expression profile of 82 CHP patients, 103 IPF patients, and 103 control samples to identify the CHP biomarkers.
METHODS: The CHP biomarkers were selected with advanced feature selection methods: Monte Carlo Feature Selection (MCFS) and Incremental Feature Selection (IFS). A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was built. Then, we analyzed these CHP biomarkers through functional enrichment analysis and differential co-expression analysis.
RESULTS: There were 674 identified CHP biomarkers. The co-expression network of these biomarkers in CHP included more negative regulations and the network structure of CHP was quite different from the network of IPF and control.
CONCLUSION: The SVM classifier may serve as an important clinical tool to address the challenging task of differentiating between CHP and IPF. Many of the biomarker genes on the differential coexpression network showed great promise in revealing the underlying mechanisms of CHP.},

While sharing several pathobiological characteristics, they also have very distinct features. Currently no effective anti-fibrotic treatments exist that can halt the progression of PF or reverse it. Our goal is to uncover potential gene targets for the development of anti-fibrotic therapies efficacious in both diseases, and those specific to SSc-PF, by identifying universal pathways and molecules driving fibrosis in SSc-PF and IPF tissues as well as those unique to SSc-PF. Using DNA microarray data, a meta-analysis of the differentially expressed (DE) genes in SSc-PF and IPF lung tissues (diseased vs. normal) was performed followed by a full systems level analysis of the common and unique transcriptomic signatures obtained. Protein-protein interaction networks were generated to identify hub proteins and explore the data using the centrality principle. Our results suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting IL6 trans-signaling, IGFBP2, IGFL2, and the coagulation cascade may be efficacious in both SSc-PF and IPF. Further, our data suggest that the expression of matrikine-producing collagens is also perturbed in PF. Lastly, an overall perturbation of bioenergetics, specifically between glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism, was uncovered in SSc-PF. Our findings provide insights into potential targets for the development of anti-fibrotic therapies that could be effective in both IPF and SSc-PF.},

The reason why some patients with IPF experience harm is unknown.

Objectives: To determine whether age-adjusted leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was associated with the harmful effect of immunosuppression in patients with IPF.

Methods: LTL was measured from available DNA samples from PANTHER-IPF (interim analysis, n = 79; final analysis, n = 118). Replication cohorts included ACE-IPF (Anticoagulant Effectiveness in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) (n = 101) and an independent observational cohort (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center-IPF, n = 170). LTL-stratified and medication-stratified survival analyses were performed using multivariable Cox regression models for composite endpoint-free survival.

Measurements and Main Results: Of the subjects enrolled in the PANTHER-IPF and ACE-IPF, 62\% (49/79) and 56\% (28/50) had an LTL less than the 10th percentile of normal, respectively. In PANTHER-IPF, exposure to prednisone/azathioprine/N-acetylcysteine was associated with a higher composite endpoint of death, lung transplantation, hospitalization, or FVC decline for those with an LTL less than the 10th percentile (hazard ratio, 2.84; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02–7.87; P = 0.045). This finding was replicated in the placebo arm of ACE-IPF for those exposed to immunosuppression (hazard ratio, 7.18; 95\% confidence interval, 1.52–33.84; P = 0.013). A propensity-matched University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center IPF cohort showed a similar association between immunosuppression and composite endpoints (death, lung transplantation, or FVC decline) for those with an LTL less than the 10th percentile (hazard ratio, 3.79; 95\% confidence interval, 1.73–8.30; P = 0.00085). An interaction was found between immunosuppression and LTL for the combined PANTHER-IPF and ACE-IPF clinical trials (Pinteraction = 0.048), and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center IPF cohort (Pinteraction = 0.00049).

Conclusions: LTL is a biomarker that may identify patients with IPF at risk for poor outcomes when exposed to immunosuppression.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease. Although the pathogenesis is poorly understood, evidence suggests that genetic and epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, may play a key role. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and are important regulators in IPF. Here we identified BMP endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER) as a key regulator of fibroblast activation. BMPER is a secreted glycoprotein that binds directly to BMPs and may regulate TGF-β/BMP signaling, but its role in lung fibrosis is not clear. BMPER is highly expressed in human IPF lung fibroblasts compared to normal lung fibroblasts. Demethylation agent 5′-azacytidine decreased BMPER expression in fibroblasts and attenuated the invasion and migration of IPF lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated reduction of BMPER in the human lung fibroblasts impaired cell migration and invasion. 5′-azacytidine treatment additionally regulated BMPER expression and reduced lung fibrosis in mice in vivo. These findings demonstrate that methylation of specific genes in fibroblasts may offer a new therapeutic strategy for IPF by modulating fibroblast activation.},

Although the pathologist's visual inspection is central in histologic assessments, three-dimensional microcomputed tomography (microCT) assessment may complement the pathologist's scoring. We examined associations between the histopathologic features of UIP and IPF in explanted lungs and quantitative microCT measurements, including alveolar surface density, total lung volume taken up by tissue (\%), and terminal bronchiolar number. Sixty frozen samples from 10 air-inflated explanted lungs with severe IPF and 36 samples from 6 donor control lungs were scanned with microCT and processed for histologic analysis. An experienced pathologist scored three major UIP criteria (patchy fibrosis, honeycomb, and fibroblastic foci), five additional pathologic changes, and immunohistochemical staining for CD68-, CD4-, CD8-, and CD79a-positive cells, graded on a 0 to 3+ scale. The alveolar surface density and terminal bronchiolar number decreased and the tissue percentage increased in lungs with IPF compared with controls. In lungs with IPF, lower alveolar surface density and higher tissue percentage were correlated with greater scores of patchy fibrosis, fibroblastic foci, honeycomb, CD79a-positive cells, and lymphoid follicles. A decreased number of terminal bronchioles was correlated with honeycomb score but not with the other scores. The three-dimensional microCT measurements reflect the pathological UIP and IPF criteria and suggest that the reduction in the terminal bronchioles may be associated with honeycomb cyst formation.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is the defining morphology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Guidelines for IPF diagnosis conditionally recommend surgical lung biopsy for histopathology diagnosis of UIP when radiology and clinical context are not definitive. A “molecular diagnosis of UIP” in transbronchial lung biopsy, the Envisia Genomic Classifier, accurately predicted histopathologic UIP.

Objectives: We evaluated the combined accuracy of the Envisia Genomic Classifier and local radiology in the detection of UIP pattern.

Methods: Ninety-six patients who had diagnostic lung pathology as well as a transbronchial lung biopsy for molecular testing with Envisia Genomic Classifier were included in this analysis. The classifier results were scored against reference pathology. UIP identified on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) as documented by features in local radiologists’ reports was compared with histopathology.

Measurements and Main Results: In 96 patients, the Envisia Classifier achieved a specificity of 92.1\% (confidence interval [CI],78.6–98.3\%) and a sensitivity of 60.3\% (CI, 46.6–73.0\%) for histology-proven UIP pattern. Local radiologists identified UIP in 18 of 53 patients with UIP histopathology, with a sensitivity of 34.0\% (CI, 21.5–48.3\%) and a specificity of 96.9\% (CI, 83.8–100\%). In conjunction with HRCT patterns of UIP, the Envisia Classifier results identified 24 additional patients with UIP (sensitivity 79.2\%; specificity 90.6\%).

Conclusions: In 96 patients with suspected interstitial lung disease, the Envisia Genomic Classifier identified UIP regardless of HRCT pattern. These results suggest that recognition of a UIP pattern by the Envisia Genomic Classifier combined with HRCT and clinical factors in a multidisciplinary discussion may assist clinicians in making an interstitial lung disease (especially IPF) diagnosis without the need for a surgical lung biopsy.},

	abstract = {Background:
The cornerstone of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) management is having
patients avoid the inciting antigen (IA). Often, despite an exhaustive
search, an IA cannot be found. The objective of this study was to examine
whether identifying the IA impacts survival in patients with chronic HP.

Methods:
We used the Kaplan-Meier method to display, and the log-rank test to compare,
survival curves of patients with well-characterized chronic HP stratified on
identification of an IA exposure. A Cox proportional hazards (PH) model was
used to identify independent predictors in time-to-death analysis.

Results:
Of 142 patients, 67 (47\%) had an identified IA, and 75 (53\%) had an
unidentified IA. Compared with survivors, patients who died (n = 80, 56\%)
were older, more likely to have smoked, had lower total lung capacity \%
predicted and FVC \% predicted, had higher severity of dyspnea, were more
likely to have pulmonary fibrosis, and were less likely to have an
identifiable IA. In a Cox PH model, the inability to identify an IA (hazard
ratio [HR], 1.76; 95\% CI, 1.01-3.07), older age (HR, 1.04; 95\% CI,
1.01-1.07), the presences of pulmonary fibrosis (HR, 2.43; 95\% CI,
1.36-4.35), a lower FVC\% (HR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.68), and a history of
smoking (HR, 2.01; 95\% C1, 1.15-3.50) were independent predictors of shorter
survival. After adjusting for mean age, presence of fibrosis, mean FVC\%,
mean diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (\%), and history of
smoking, survival was longer for patients with an identified IA exposure
than those with an unidentified IA exposure (median, 8.75 years vs 4.88
years; P = .047).

Conclusions:
Among patients with chronic HP, when adjusting for a number of potentially
influential predictors, including the presence of fibrosis, the inability to
identify an IA was independently associated with shortened survival.},

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.

	doi = {10.1016/S2213-2600(19)30059-1},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the appropriate clinical setting, the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) requires a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia to be present on high-resolution chest CT (HRCT) or surgical lung biopsy. A molecular usual interstitial pneumonia signature can be identified by a machine learning algorithm in less-invasive transbronchial lung biopsy samples. We report prospective findings for the clinical validity and utility of this molecular test.
METHODS: We prospectively recruited 237 patients for this study from those enrolled in the Bronchial Sample Collection for a Novel Genomic Test (BRAVE) study in 29 US and European sites. Patients were undergoing evaluation for interstitial lung disease and had had samples obtained by clinically indicated surgical or transbronchial biopsy or cryobiopsy for pathology. Histopathological diagnoses were made by experienced pathologists. Available HRCT scans were reviewed centrally. Three to five transbronchial lung biopsy samples were collected from all patients specifically for this study, pooled by patient, and extracted for transcriptomic sequencing. After exclusions, diagnostic histopathology and RNA sequence data from 90 patients were used to train a machine learning algorithm (Envisia Genomic Classifier, Veracyte, San Francisco, CA, USA) to identify a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern. The primary study endpoint was validation of the classifier in 49 patients by comparison with diagnostic histopathology. To assess clinical utility, we compared the agreement and confidence level of diagnosis made by central multidisciplinary teams based on anonymised clinical information and radiology results plus either molecular classifier or histopathology results.
FINDINGS: The classifier identified usual interstitial pneumonia in transbronchial lung biopsy samples from 49 patients with 88\% specificity (95\% CI 70-98) and 70\% sensitivity (47-87). Among 42 of these patients who had possible or inconsistent usual interstitial pneumonia on HRCT, the classifier showed 81\% positive predictive value (95\% CI 54-96) for underlying biopsy-proven usual interstitial pneumonia. In the clinical utility analysis, we found 86\% agreement (95\% CI 78-92) between clinical diagnoses using classifier results and those using histopathology data. Diagnostic confidence was improved by the molecular classifier results compared with histopathology results in 18 with IPF diagnoses (proportion of diagnoses that were confident or provisional with high confidence 89\% vs 56\%, p=0·0339) and in all 48 patients with non-diagnostic pathology or non-classifiable fibrosis histopathology (63\% vs 42\%, p=0·0412).
INTERPRETATION: The molecular test provided an objective method to aid clinicians and multidisciplinary teams in ascertaining a diagnosis of IPF, particularly for patients without a clear radiological diagnosis, in samples that can be obtained by a less invasive method. Further prospective clinical validation and utility studies are planned.

	abstract = {Rationale: Novel therapies for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are in development, but there remains uncertainty about the optimal trial endpoint. An earlier endpoint would enable assessment of a greater number of therapies in adaptive trial designs.

Objectives: To determine whether short-term changes in FVC, DlCO, and six-minute-walk distance could act as surrogate endpoints to accelerate early-phase trials in IPF.

Methods: Individual participant data (IPD) from IPF clinical trials were included in a two-step random-effects meta-analysis to determine whether baseline or 3-month changes in FVC, DlCO, and 6-minute-walk distance were associated with mortality or disease progression in placebo arms. Three-month and 12-month FVC decline endpoints were compared with treatment arm data from antifibrotic studies by meta-regression.

Measurements and Main Results: IPD were available from 12 placebo cohorts totaling 1,819 participants, with baseline and 3-month changes in all physiological variables independently associated with poorer outcomes. Treatment data were available from six cohorts with 1,684 participants. For each 2.5\% relative decline in FVC over 3 months, there was an associated 15\% (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.06–1.24; I2 = 59.4\%) and 20\% (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.12–1.28; I2 = 18.0\%) increased risk for mortality in untreated and treated individuals, respectively. An FVC change treatment effect was observed between treatment and placebo arms at 3 months (difference in FVC change of 42.9 ml; 95\% CI, 24.0–61.8 ml; P {\textless} 0.001).

Conclusions: IPD meta-analysis demonstrated that 3-month changes in physiological variables, particularly FVC, were associated with mortality among individuals with IPF. FVC change over 3 months may hold potential as a surrogate endpoint in IPF adaptive trials.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (fHP) is an interstitial lung disease caused by sensitization to an inhaled allergen.

Objectives: To identify the molecular determinants associated with progression of fibrosis.

Methods: Nine fHP explant lungs and six unused donor lungs (as controls) were systematically sampled (4 samples/lung). According to microcomputed tomography measures, fHP cores were clustered into mild, moderate, and severe fibrosis groups. Gene expression profiles were assessed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, xCell, gene ontology, and structure enrichment analysis. Gene expression of the prevailing molecular traits was also compared with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The explant lung findings were evaluated in separate clinical fHP cohorts using tissue, BAL samples, and computed tomography scans.

Measurements and Main Results: We found six molecular traits that associated with differential lung involvement. In fHP, extracellular matrix and antigen presentation/sensitization transcriptomic signatures characterized lung zones with only mild structural and histological changes, whereas signatures involved in honeycombing and B cells dominated the transcriptome in the most severely affected lung zones. With increasing disease severity, endothelial function was progressively lost, and progressive disruption in normal cellular homeostatic processes emerged. All six were also found in IPF, with largely similar associations with disease microenvironments. The molecular traits correlated with in vivo disease behavior in a separate clinical fHP cohort.

Conclusions: We identified six molecular traits that characterize the morphological progression of fHP and associate with in vivo clinical behavior. Comparing IPF with fHP, the transcriptome landscape was determined considerably by local disease extent rather than by diagnosis alone.},

	abstract = {Ribosomal protein L7 has been established recently as a novel autoantigen representing a frequent target for autoantibodies from patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. Up to 75\% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and 50\% of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) patients produce antibodies in vitro translated L7 and form immunoprecipitable complexes. In this study the B cell response to protein L7 was investigated with respect to the immunogenic determinants recognized by autoantibodies. Eighteen truncated fragments of protein L7 were generated as recombinant fusions with glutathione-S-transferase and examined by immunoblotting for their reactivity with sera from patients suffering from systemic rheumatic diseases. Anti-L7 antibodies target three major nonoverlapping autoepitopes. Two epitopes reside in the highly conserved C-terminal part of the protein, whereas the N-terminal autoepitope is not conserved during evolution. The N-terminal epitope comprises 24 amino acid residues. Ten amino acid resides of this epitope are shared with the BZIP-like RNA binding domain of protein L7. Autoantibodies recognizing this epitope crossreact with the corresponding region of a L7 homologue, namely ribosomal protein L7 (RPL7) from Dictyostelium discoideum. This indicates that amino acid residues 14VPE...KKR22, which are conserved between humans and fungi, contribute essentially to the formation of autoantibody-autoantigen complexes.},

By means of an ELISA employing recombinant protein L7 as antigen we detected anti-L7 autoantobodies in 172 of 506 SLE sera (34\%). Negative correlations were observed between the presence of anti-L7 autoantibodies, serum IgG levels and proteinuria; a potentially positive relationship existed with lung fibrosis. In order to analyse further this possibility we screened sera of 129 patients suffering from progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) for anti-L7 reactivity; 45 of these patients had lung fibrosis. Of the PSS patients, 41\% exhibited anti-L7 autoantibodies, but positive reactions were evenly distributed among patients with and without lung fibrosis.

Recently, aberrant basaloid cells were identified in fibrotic lung tissue as a novel epithelial cell type displaying a partial EMT phenotype. The developmental origin of these cells remains unknown. To elucidate the role of EMT in the development of aberrant basaloid cells from the bronchial epithelium, we mapped EMT-induced transcriptional changes at the population and single-cell levels. Human bronchial epithelial cells grown as submerged or air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures with or without EMT induction were analyzed by bulk and single-cell RNA-Sequencing. Comparison of submerged and ALI cultures revealed differential expression of 8,247 protein coding (PC) and 1,621 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes and revealed epithelial cell-type-specific lncRNAs. Similarly, EMT induction in ALI cultures resulted in robust transcriptional reprogramming of 6,020 PC and 907 lncRNA genes. Although there was no evidence for fibroblast/myofibroblast conversion following EMT induction, cells displayed a partial EMT gene signature and an aberrant basaloid-like cell phenotype. The substantial transcriptional differences between submerged and ALI cultures highlight that care must be taken when interpreting data from submerged cultures. This work supports that lung epithelial EMT does not generate fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and confirms ALI cultures provide a physiologically relevant system to study aberrant basaloid-like cells and mechanisms of EMT. We provide a catalog of PC and lncRNA genes and an interactive browser (https://bronc-epi-in-vitro.cells.ucsc.edu/) of single-cell RNA-Seq data for further exploration of potential roles in the lung epithelium in health and lung disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal disorder characterized by fibroproliferation and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lung.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using oligonucleotide arrays, we identified osteopontin as one of the genes that significantly distinguishes IPF from normal lungs. Osteopontin was localized to alveolar epithelial cells in IPF lungs and was also significantly elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage from IPF patients. To study the fibrosis-relevant effects of osteopontin we stimulated primary human lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells (A549) with recombinant osteopontin. Osteopontin induced a significant increase of migration and proliferation in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Epithelial growth was inhibited by the pentapeptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) and antibody to CD44, while fibroproliferation was inhibited by GRGDS and antibody to alphavbeta3 integrin. Fibroblast and epithelial cell migration were inhibited by GRGDS, anti-CD44, and anti-alphavbeta3. In fibroblasts, osteopontin up-regulated tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 and type I collagen, and down-regulated matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) expression, while in A549 cells it caused up-regulation of MMP-7. In human IPF lungs, osteopontin colocalized with MMP-7 in alveolar epithelial cells, and application of weakest link statistical models to microarray data suggested a significant interaction between osteopontin and MMP-7.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a potential mechanism by which osteopontin secreted from the alveolar epithelium may exert a profibrotic effect in IPF lungs and highlight osteopontin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in this incurable disease.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and typically fatal lung disease. To gain insight into IPF pathogenesis, we performed gene expression profiling of IPF lungs. Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, was found among the most consistently and highly up-regulated genes and was expressed in nuclei of type II epithelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts in IPF lungs. We studied the function of Twist1 in fibroblasts further, because they are the major effector cells in this disease and persist despite an ambient proapoptotic environment. Twist1 was induced by the profibrotic growth factors (GFs) basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor in primary rat lung fibroblasts (RLFs). Suppression of Twist1 expression resulted in decreased RLF accumulation due to increased apoptosis, whereas Twist1 overexpression protected RLFs against several apoptotic stimuli. Addition of platelet-derived growth factor in combination with other GFs led to an increase in proliferation. When Twist1 was depleted, GFs continued to act as mitogens but caused a marked increase in cell death. The increase in apoptosis under basal or growth factor-stimulated conditions was partly mediated by up-regulation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bim and PUMA. These findings indicate that Twist1 promotes survival and accumulation of fibroblasts by shaping their responsiveness to growth factor stimulation. We propose that Twist1 represents one of the factors that promotes pathogenic accumulation of fibroblasts in fibrotic lung disease.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: The molecular mechanisms underlying acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are poorly understood. We studied the global gene expression signature of acute exacerbations of IPF.
OBJECTIVES: To understand the gene expression patterns of acute exacerbations of IPF.
METHODS: RNA was extracted from 23 stable IPF lungs, 8 IPF lungs with acute exacerbation (IPF-AEx), and 15 control lungs and used for hybridization on Agilent gene expression microarrays. Functional analysis of genes was performed with Spotfire and Genomica. Gene validations for MMP1, MMP7, AGER, DEFA1-3, COL1A2, and CCNA2 were performed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end-labeling assays were performed on the same tissues used for the microarray. ELISA for alpha-defensins was performed on plasma from control subjects, patients with stable IPF, and patients with IPF-AEx.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gene expression patterns in IPF-AEx and IPF samples were similar for the genes that distinguish IPF from control lungs. Five hundred and seventy-nine genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate {\textless} 5\%) between stable IPF and IPF-AEx. Functional analysis of these genes did not indicate any evidence of an infectious or overwhelming inflammatory etiology. CCNA2 and alpha-defensins were among the most up-regulated genes. CCNA2 and alpha-defensin protein levels were also higher and localized to the epithelium of IPF-AEx, where widespread apoptosis was also detected. alpha-Defensin protein levels were increased in the peripheral blood of patients with IPF-AEx.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IPF-AEx is characterized by enhanced epithelial injury and proliferation, as reflected by increases in CCNA2 and alpha-defensins and apoptosis of epithelium. The concomitant increase in alpha-defensins in the peripheral blood and lungs may suggest their use as biomarkers for this disorder.},

This investigation aimed to identify genes involved specifically in the pathogenesis of PAH and not other forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Using genomewide microarray analysis, we generated the largest data set to date of RNA expression profiles from lung tissue specimens from 1) 18 PAH subjects and 2) 8 subjects with PH secondary to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 3) 13 normal subjects. A molecular signature of 4,734 genes discriminated among these three cohorts. We identified significant novel biological changes that were likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of PAH, including regulation of actin-based motility, protein ubiquitination, and cAMP, transforming growth factor-beta, MAPK, estrogen receptor, nitric oxide, and PDGF signaling. Bone morphogenic protein receptor type II expression was downregulated, even in subjects without a mutation in this gene. Women with PAH had higher expression levels of estrogen receptor 1 than normal women. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed differential expression of the following genes in PAH relative to both normal controls and PH secondary to IPF: a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif 9, cell adhesion molecule with homology to L1CAM, cytochrome b(558) and beta-polypeptide, coagulation factor II receptor-like 3, A-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog 1, nuclear receptor coactivator 2, purinergic receptor P2Y, platelet factor 4, phospholamban, and tropomodulin 3.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary complications, including pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), are the leading cause of mortality in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). The aim of this study was to compare the molecular fingerprint of lung tissue and matching primary fibroblasts from patients with SSc with that of lung tissue and fibroblasts from normal donors, patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).
METHODS: Lung tissue samples were obtained from 33 patients with SSc who underwent lung transplantation. Tissues and cells from a subgroup of SSc patients with predominantly PF or PAH were compared to those from normal donors, patients with IPF, and patients with IPAH. Microarray data were analyzed using efficiency analysis for determination of the optimal data-processing methods. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used to confirm differential levels of messenger RNA and protein, respectively.
RESULTS: Consensus efficiency analysis identified 242 and 335 genes that were differentially expressed in lungs and primary fibroblasts, respectively. SSc-PF and IPF lungs shared enriched functional groups in genes implicated in fibrosis, insulin-like growth factor signaling, and caveolin-mediated endocytosis. Gene functional groups shared by SSc-PAH and IPAH lungs included those involved in antigen presentation, chemokine activity, and interleukin-17 signaling.
CONCLUSION: Using microarray analysis on carefully phenotyped SSc and comparator lung tissues, we demonstrated distinct molecular profiles in tissues and fibroblasts from patients with SSc-associated lung disease compared to idiopathic forms of lung disease. Unique molecular signatures were generated that are disease specific (SSc) and phenotype specific (PF versus PAH). These signatures provide new insights into the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of SSc-related lung disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The accurate diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a major clinical challenge. We developed a model to diagnose IPF by applying Bayesian probit regression (BPR) modelling to gene expression profiles of whole lung tissue.
METHODS: Whole lung tissue was obtained from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) undergoing surgical lung biopsy or lung transplantation. Controls were obtained from normal organ donors. We performed cluster analyses to explore differences in our dataset. No significant difference was found between samples obtained from different lobes of the same patient. A significant difference was found between samples obtained at biopsy versus explant. Following preliminary analysis of the complete dataset, we selected three subsets for the development of diagnostic gene signatures: the first signature was developed from all IPF samples (as compared to controls); the second signature was developed from the subset of IPF samples obtained at biopsy; the third signature was developed from IPF explants. To assess the validity of each signature, we used an independent cohort of IPF and normal samples. Each signature was used to predict phenotype (IPF versus normal) in samples from the validation cohort. We compared the models' predictions to the true phenotype of each validation sample, and then calculated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.
RESULTS: Surprisingly, we found that all three signatures were reasonably valid predictors of diagnosis, with small differences in test sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first use of BPR on whole lung tissue; previously, BPR was primarily used to develop predictive models for cancer. This also represents the first report of an independently validated IPF gene expression signature. In summary, BPR is a promising tool for the development of gene expression signatures from non-neoplastic lung tissue. In the future, BPR might be used to develop definitive diagnostic gene signatures for IPF, prognostic gene signatures for IPF or gene signatures for other non-neoplastic lung disorders such as bronchiolitis obliterans.},

We sequenced messenger RNA from 8 IPF lung samples and 7 healthy controls on an Illumina HiSeq 2000, and found evidence for substantial differential gene expression and differential splicing. 873 genes were differentially expressed in IPF (FDR{\textless}5\%), and 440 unique genes had significant differential splicing events in at least one exonic region (FDR{\textless}5\%). We used qPCR to validate the differential exon usage in the second and third most significant exonic regions, in the genes COL6A3 (RNA-Seq adjusted pval = 7.18e-10) and POSTN (RNA-Seq adjusted pval = 2.06e-09), which encode the extracellular matrix proteins collagen alpha-3(VI) and periostin. The increased gene-level expression of periostin has been associated with IPF and its clinical progression, but its differential splicing has not been studied in the context of this disease. Our results suggest that alternative splicing of these and other genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. We have developed an interactive web application which allows users to explore the results of our RNA-Seq experiment, as well as those of two previously published microarray experiments, and we hope that this will serve as a resource for future investigations of gene regulation in IPF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is microscopic spatial and temporal heterogeneity of pathological changes in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung tissue, which may relate to heterogeneity in pathophysiological mediators of disease and clinical progression. We assessed relationships between gene expression patterns, pathological features, and systemic biomarkers to identify biomarkers that reflect the aggregate disease burden in patients with IPF.
METHODS: Gene expression microarrays (N=40 IPF; 8 controls) and immunohistochemical analyses (N=22 IPF; 8 controls) of lung biopsies. Clinical characterisation and blood biomarker levels of MMP3 and CXCL13 in a separate cohort of patients with IPF (N=80).
RESULTS: 2940 genes were significantly differentially expressed between IPF and control samples ({\textbar}fold change{\textbar} {\textgreater}1.5, p{\textless}0.05). Two clusters of co-regulated genes related to bronchiolar epithelium or lymphoid aggregates exhibited substantial heterogeneity within the IPF population. Gene expression in bronchiolar and lymphoid clusters corresponded to the extent of bronchiolisation and lymphoid aggregates determined by immunohistochemistry in adjacent tissue sections. Elevated serum levels of MMP3, encoded in the bronchiolar cluster, and CXCL13, encoded in the lymphoid cluster, corresponded to disease severity and shortened survival time (p{\textless}10(-7) for MMP3 and p{\textless}10(-5) for CXCL13; Cox proportional hazards model).
CONCLUSIONS: Microscopic pathological heterogeneity in IPF lung tissue corresponds to specific gene expression patterns related to bronchiolisation and lymphoid aggregates. MMP3 and CXCL13 are systemic biomarkers that reflect the aggregate burden of these pathological features across total lung tissue. These biomarkers may have clinical utility as prognostic and/or surrogate biomarkers of disease activity in interventional studies in IPF.},

	abstract = {Background: Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP) is characterized by varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis of the lungs caused by a variety of inhaled antigens. Despite extensive efforts to minimize exposure to the antigens, patients with CHP sometimes experience rapid deterioration of their pulmonary functions, resulting in death within a few years. Objectives: This study aimed to define clearly the clinical and molecular features of patients with rapidly progressive CHP. Methods: Annual decline in pulmonary functions and its association with clinical variables was evaluated in 43 patients with CHP. The RNA from frozen lung specimens of nine patients with rapidly progressive CHP and normal control subjects was profiled using Illumina HumanWG-6 v3 Expression BeadChips, and an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was performed to identify the altered functional and canonical signaling pathways. Results: Patients with more than 10\% annual decline in forced vital capacity and those with more than 15\% annual decline in diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide showed significantly poor overall survival rates (p=0.002 and p=0.001, respectively). According to the gene expression analysis, 160 genes, including cystatin SN (CST1), ephrin-A2 (EFNA2), and wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 7B (WNT7B) were upregulated, and pathways related to inflammatory responses and autoimmune diseases were differentially expressed. Conclusion: Greater annual decline in pulmonary function can predict poorer prognosis of patients with CHP. Genes and pathways related to inflammatory responses and autoimmune diseases have potential roles in the pathogenesis of rapidly progressive CHP, suggesting their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets.

Bone morphogenetic protein 3 (BMP3) is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) super-family, which has not been implicated in pulmonary fibrosis previously. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of BMP3 playing in pulmonary fibrosis from clinical diagnosis to molecular signaling regulation. RNA sequencing was performed to explore the potential biomarker of IIP patients. The expression of BMP3 was evaluated in 83 cases of IPF and INSIP by immunohistochemistry. The function of BMP3 was investigated in both fibroblast cells and a bleomycin-induced murine pulmonary fibrosis model. The clinical relevance of BMP3 expression were analyzed in 47 IIP patients, which were included in 83 cases and possess more than five-year follow-up data. Both RNA-sequencing and immunohistochemistry staining revealed that BMP3 was significantly down-regulated in lung tissues of patients with IPF and INSIP. Consistently, lower expression of BMP3 also was found in pulmonary fibrotic tissues of bleomycin-induced mice model. Up-regulation of BMP3 prevented pulmonary fibrosis processing through inhibiting cellular proliferation of fibroblasts as well as TGF-β1 signal transduction. Finally, the relatively higher expression of BMP3 in IPF patients was associated with less/worse mortality. Intravenous injection of recombinant BMP3. Taken together, our results suggested that the low expression level of BMP3 may indicate the unfavorable prognosis of IPF patients, targeting BMP3 may represent a novel potential therapeutic method for pulmonary fibrosis management.},

Extent of fibrosis in each sample was assessed by microCT-measured alveolar surface density (ASD) and confirmed by histology. Regulatory gene expression networks were identified using linear mixed-effect models and dynamic regulatory events miner (DREM). Differential gene expression analysis identified a core set of genes increased or decreased before fibrosis was histologically evident that continued to change with advanced fibrosis. DREM generated a systems biology model (www.sb.cs.cmu.edu/IPFReg) that identified progressively divergent gene expression tracks with microRNAs and transcription factors that specifically regulate mild or advanced fibrosis. We confirmed model predictions by demonstrating that expression of POU2AF1, previously unassociated with lung fibrosis but proposed by the model as regulator, is increased in B lymphocytes in IPF lungs and that POU2AF1-knockout mice were protected from bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Our results reveal distinct regulation of gene expression changes in IPF tissue that remained structurally normal compared with moderate or advanced fibrosis and suggest distinct regulatory mechanisms for each stage.},

While increased markers of senescence have been reported in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the origin and identity of these senescent cells remain unclear, and tools to characterize context-specific cellular senescence in human lung are lacking. We observed that the senescent marker p16 is predominantly localized to bronchiolized epithelial structures in scarred regions of IPF and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) lung tissue, overlapping with the basal epithelial markers Keratin 5 and Keratin 17. Using in vitro models, we derived transcriptional signatures of senescence programming specific to different types of lung epithelial cells and interrogated these signatures in a single-cell RNA-Seq data set derived from control, IPF, and SSc-ILD lung tissue. We identified a population of basal epithelial cells defined by, and enriched for, markers of cellular senescence and identified candidate markers specific to senescent basal epithelial cells in ILD that can enable future functional studies. Notably, gene expression of these cells significantly overlaps with terminally differentiating cells in stratified epithelia, where it is driven by p53 activation as part of the senescence program.},

Objectives: To determine functional relevance of the 10 IPF-associated common genetic variants we previously identified. Methods: We performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) mapping, followed by co-localization of eQTL and mQTL with genetic association signals and functional validation by luciferase reporter assays. Illumina multi-ethnic genotyping arrays, mRNA sequencing, and Illumina 850k methylation arrays were performed on lung tissue of participants with IPF (234 RNA and 345 DNA samples) and non-diseased controls (188 RNA and 202 DNA samples). Measurements and Main Results: Focusing on genetic variants within 10 IPF-associated genetic loci, we identified 27 eQTLs in controls and 24 eQTLs in cases (false-discovery-rate-adjusted P {\textless} 0.05). Among these signals, we identified associations of lead variants rs35705950 with expression of MUC5B and rs2076295 with expression of DSP in both cases and controls. mQTL analysis identified CpGs in gene bodies of MUC5B (cg17589883) and DSP (cg08964675) associated with the lead variants in these two loci. We also demonstrated strong co-localization of eQTL/mQTL and genetic signal in MUC5B (rs35705950) and DSP (rs2076295). Functional validation of the mQTL in MUC5B using luciferase reporter assays demonstrates that the CpG resides within a putative internal repressor element. Conclusions: We have established a relationship of the common IPF genetic risk variants rs35705950 and rs2076295 with respective changes in MUC5B and DSP expression and methylation. These results provide additional evidence that both MUC5B and DSP are involved in the etiology of IPF.},

Here, we report that RNA sequencing of lung biopsies from patients with RA-ILD and IPF revealed shared and distinct disease-causing pathways. Analysis of transcriptomic data identified a JAK2 related JAK/STAT signaling pathway gene signature that distinguishes RA-UIP from idiopathic UIP. This was further confirmed by immunohistostaining, which identified JAK2 phosphorylation with two distinct forms of activation: a cytoplasmic form of JAK2 activation in most IPF cases (13/20) and a nuclear form of p-JAK2 in RA-UIP (5/5) and a minority of IPF (6/20) cases. Further immunohistostaining identified STAT5A\&B as the downstream transcriptional activator for JAK2-mediated canonical signal transduction and phosphorylation of Tyr41 on histone H3 (H3Y41ph) as the downstream epigenetic regulation site for JAK2-mediated noncanonical signal transduction. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the RNA-Seq data further supported this shared pathogenic mechanism for the two diseases with the enrichment of STAT5A\&B target gene sets as well as the JAK2 regulated H3Y41ph target gene set. This regulatory role of JAK2 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis was further demonstrated by the attenuation of bleomycin-induced murine pulmonary fibrosis using a JAK2-selective pharmacological inhibitor CEP33779. In vitro studies with normal and IPF derived lung fibroblasts revealed a central role for JAK2 as an essential intermediary molecule in TGF-β-mediated myofibroblast trans-differentiation, proliferation, and extracellular matrix protein production. These observations support a crucial role for JAK2 as an intermediary molecule in fibrotic lung disease development.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressively fibrotic lung condition with poor prognosis. Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) is a protein secreted by epithelial cells in IPF lungs. It is not known if MMP7 expression correlates with fibrotic changes in lung tissue.
METHODS: Tissue samples from lung apices and bases were obtained from 20 IPF patients and 14 non-diseased control (NDC) donors. In formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections, histological assessment of fibrosis was performed; overall MMP7 positivity was assessed by immunohistochemistry and MMP7+ cells were quantified using multiplex immunohistochemistry. Protein expression of MMP7 in whole lung lysates was quantified by Western blotting. Bulk tissue transcriptomic profiles of 101 samples were analysed using RNA sequencing technologies.
RESULTS: Lung tissue from IPF bases was more fibrotic than in apices. MMP7 protein is elevated in IPF lung base tissue. In IPF whole lung lysates, MMP7 protein levels are increased compared to NDC donors and was increased in IPF lung bases compared to apices. MMP7 protein levels correlated with MMP7 gene expression levels in lung tissue. MMP7 transcript levels were increased in IPF base compared to NDC base lung tissue and increased in IPF base tissue compared to IPF apex tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Our cross-sectional study suggests that lung epithelial MMP7 expression increases as the tissue becomes more fibrotic and identifies a potentially nonepithelial or immune-cell source. Mechanisms of disease progression in IPF are still unclear, and our study suggests aberrant MMP7 production may be a histological starting point of lung tissue fibrosis.},

	abstract = {Background: Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is the histopathologic hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the prototypical interstitial lung disease (ILD). Diagnosis of IPF requires that a typical UIP pattern be identified by using high-resolution chest computed tomography or lung sampling. A genomic classifier for UIP has been developed to predict histopathologic UIP by using lung samples obtained through bronchoscopy.

Objective: To perform a systematic review to evaluate genomic classifier testing in the detection of histopathologic UIP to inform new American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Asociación Latinoamericana del Tórax guidelines.

Data Sources: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through June 2020.

Data Extraction: Data were extracted from studies that enrolled patients with ILD and reported the use of genomic classifier testing.

Synthesis: Data were aggregated across studies via meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence was appraised by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

Results: Genomic classifier testing had a sensitivity of 68\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 55–73\%) and a specificity of 92\% (95\% CI, 81–95\%) in predicting the UIP pattern in ILD. Confidence in an IPF diagnosis increased from 43\% to 93\% in one cohort and from 59\% to 89\% in another cohort. Agreement levels in categorical IPF and non-IPF diagnoses measured by using a concordance coefficient were 0.75 and 0.64 in the two cohorts. The quality of evidence was moderate for test characteristics and very low for both confidence and agreement.

Conclusions: Genomic classifier testing predicts histopathologic UIP in patients with ILD with a specificity of 92\% and improves diagnostic confidence; however, sensitivity is only 68\%, and testing is not widely available.},

	abstract = {Background
The clinical course of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is unpredictable. Clinical prediction tools are not accurate enough to predict disease outcomes.

Methods
All-comers with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis diagnosis were enrolled in a six-cohort study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells or whole blood was collected at baseline from 425 participants and during follow up from 98 patients. The 52-gene signature was measured by the nCounter® analysis system in four cohorts and extracted from microarray data in two others. The Scoring Algorithm for Molecular Subphenotypes (SAMS) was used to classify patients into low or high risk groups based on a 52-gene signature. Mortality and transplant-free survival were studied using Competing risk and Cox proportional-hazard models, respectively. Time course data and response to anti-fibrotic drugs were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models.

Findings
The application of SAMS to the 52-gene signature identified two groups of IPF patients (low and high risk) with significant differences in mortality or transplant-free survival in each of the six cohorts (HR 2·03–4·37). Pooled data revealed similar results for mortality (HR:2·18, 95\%CI:1·53–3·09, P{\textless}0·0001) or transplant-free survival (HR:2·04, 95\%CI: 1·52–2·74, P{\textless}0·0001). Adding 52-gene risk profiles to the Gender, Age and Physiology (GAP) index significantly improved its mortality predictive accuracy. Temporal changes in SAMS scores were associated with changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) in two cohorts. Untreated patients did not shift their risk profile over time. A simultaneous increase in up score and decrease in down score was predictive of transplant-free survival (HR:3·18· 95\%CI 1·16, 8·76, P=0·025) in the Pittsburgh cohort. A simultaneous decrease in up score and increase in down score after initiation of anti-fibrotic drugs was associated with a significant (P=0·005) improvement in FVC in the Yale cohort.

Interpretation
The peripheral blood 52-gene expression signature is predictive of outcome in patients with IPF. The potential value of the 52-gene signature in predicting response to therapy should be determined in prospective studies.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Contribution of central lung tissues to pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the relationship between cell types of IPF-central and IPF-peripheral lung explants using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptome.
METHODS: Biopsies of paired IPF-central and IPF-peripheral along with non-IPF lungs were selected by reviewing H\&E data. Criteria for differentially expressed genes (DEG) were set at false discovery rate {\textless}5\% and fold change {\textgreater}2. Computational cell composition deconvolution was performed. Signature scores were computed for each cell type.
FINDINGS: Comparison of central IPF versus non-IPF identified 1723 DEG (1522 upregulated and 201 downregulated). Sixty-two per cent (938/1522) of the mutually upregulated genes in central IPF genes were also upregulated in peripheral IPF versus non-IPF. Moreover, 85 IPF central-associated genes (CAG) were upregulated in central IPF versus both peripheral IPF and central non-IPF. IPF single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed the highest CAG signature score in myofibroblasts and significantly correlated with a previously published activated fibroblasts signature (r=0.88, p=1.6×10-4). CAG signature scores were significantly higher in IPF than in non-IPF myofibroblasts (p=0.013). Network analysis of central-IPF genes identified a module significantly correlated with the deconvoluted proportion of myofibroblasts in central IPF and anti-correlated with inflammation foci trait in peripheral IPF. The module genes were over-represented in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis signalling pathways.
INTERPRETATION: Gene expression in central IPF lung regions demonstrates active myofibroblast features that contributes to disease progression. Further elucidation of pathological transcriptomic state of cells in the central regions of the IPF lung that are relatively spared from morphological rearrangements may provide insights into molecular changes in the IPF progression.},

Analyses of microRNA and gene expression in IPF have yielded potentially predictive information. However, the relationship between microRNA/gene expression and quantitative phenotypic value in IPF remains controversial, as is the added value of this approach to current molecular signatures in IPF. To identify biomarkers predictive of survival in IPF via a microRNA-driven strategy. We profiled microRNA and protein-coding gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 70 IPF subjects in a discovery cohort. We linked the microRNA/gene expression level with the quantitative phenotypic variation in IPF, including diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide and the forced vital capacity percent predicted. In silico analyses of expression profiles and quantitative phenotypic data allowed the generation of two sets of IPF molecular signatures (unique for microRNAs and protein-coding genes) that predict IPF survival. Each signature performed well in a validation cohort comprised of IPF patients aggregated from distinct patient populations recruited from different sites. Resampling test suggests that the protein-coding gene based signature is comparable and potentially superior to published IPF prognostic gene signatures. In conclusion, these results highlight the utility of microRNA-driven peripheral blood molecular signatures as valuable and novel biomarkers associated to individuals at high survival risk and for potentially facilitating individualized therapies in this enigmatic disorder.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, although M. tuberculosis may play a role in the pathogenesis. The traditional view holds that inflammation in sarcoidosis is compartmentalized to involved organs.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether whole blood gene expression signatures reflect inflammatory pathways in the lung in sarcoidosis and whether these signatures overlap with tuberculosis.
METHODS: We analyzed transcriptomic data from blood and lung biopsies in sarcoidosis and compared these profiles with blood transcriptomic data from tuberculosis and other diseases.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Applying machine learning algorithms to blood gene expression data, we built a classifier that distinguished sarcoidosis from health in derivation and validation cohorts (92\% sensitivity, 92\% specificity). The most discriminative genes were confirmed by quantitative PCR and correlated with disease severity. Transcript profiles significantly induced in blood overlapped with those in lung biopsies and identified shared dominant inflammatory pathways (e.g., Type-I/II interferons). Sarcoidosis and tuberculosis shared more overlap in blood gene expression compared with other diseases using the 86-gene signature reported to be specific for tuberculosis and the sarcoidosis signature presented herein, although reapplication of machine learning algorithms could identify genes specific for sarcoidosis.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that blood transcriptome analysis provides a noninvasive method for identifying inflammatory pathways in sarcoidosis, that these pathways may be leveraged to complement more invasive procedures for diagnosis or assessment of disease severity, and that sarcoidosis and tuberculosis share overlap in gene regulation of specific inflammatory pathways.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To characterise the peripheral blood cell (PBC) gene expression changes ensuing from mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or cyclophosphamide (CYC) treatment and to determine the predictive significance of baseline PBC transcript scores for response to immunosuppression in systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related interstitial lung disease (ILD).
METHODS: PBC RNA samples from baseline and 12-month visits, corresponding to the active treatment period of both arms in Scleroderma Lung Study II, were investigated by global RNA sequencing. Joint models were created to examine the predictive significance of baseline composite modular scores for the course of forced vital capacity (FVC) per cent predicted measurements from 3 to 12 months.
RESULTS: 134 patients with SSc-ILD (CYC=69 and MMF=65) were investigated. CYC led to an upregulation of erythropoiesis, inflammation and myeloid lineage-related modules and a downregulation of lymphoid lineage-related modules. The modular changes resulting from MMF treatment were more modest and included a downregulation of plasmablast module. In the longitudinal analysis, none of the baseline transcript module scores showed predictive significance for FVC\% course in the CYC arm. In contrast, in the MMF arm, higher baseline lymphoid lineage modules predicted better subsequent FVC\% course, while higher baseline myeloid lineage and inflammation modules predicted worse subsequent FVC\% course.
CONCLUSION: Consistent with the primary mechanism of action of MMF on lymphocytes, patients with SSc-ILD with higher baseline lymphoid module scores had better FVC\% course, while those with higher myeloid cell lineage activation score had poorer FVC\% course on MMF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is a powerful tool for the identification of surrogate markers involved in disease processes. The hypothesis tested in this study was that chronic exposure of PBMCs to a hypertensive environment in remodeled pulmonary vessels would be reflected by specific transcriptional changes in these cells.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The transcript profiles of PBMCs from 30 idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (IPAH), 19 patients with systemic sclerosis without pulmonary hypertension (SSc), 42 scleroderma-associated pulmonary arterial hypertensio patients (SSc-PAH), and 8 patients with SSc complicated by interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension (SSc-PH-ILD) were compared to the gene expression profiles of PBMCs from 41 healthy individuals. Multiple gene expression signatures were identified which could distinguish various disease groups from controls. One of these signatures, specific for erythrocyte maturation, is enriched specifically in patients with PH. This association was validated in multiple published datasets. The erythropoiesis signature was strongly correlated with hemodynamic measures of increasing disease severity in IPAH patients. No significant correlation of the same type was noted for SSc-PAH patients, this despite a clear signature enrichment within this group overall. These findings suggest an association of the erythropoiesis signature in PBMCs from patients with PH with a variable presentation among different subtypes of disease.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In PH, the expansion of immature red blood cell precursors may constitute a response to the increasingly hypoxic conditions prevalent in this syndrome. A correlation of this erythrocyte signature with more severe hypertension cases may provide an important biomarker of disease progression.},

Microarray analyses identified 52 genes associated with transplant-free survival (TFS) in the discovery cohort. Clustering the microarray samples of the replication cohort using the 52-gene outcome-predictive signature distinguished two patient groups with significant differences in TFS. We studied the pathways associated with TFS in each independent microarray cohort and identified decreased expression of “The costimulatory signal during T cell activation” Biocarta pathway and, in particular, the genes CD28, ICOS, LCK, and ITK, results confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A proportional hazards model, including the qRT-PCR expression of CD28, ICOS, LCK, and ITK along with patient’s age, gender, and percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC\%), demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 78.5\% at 2.4 months for death and lung transplant prediction in the replication cohort. To evaluate the potential cellular source of CD28, ICOS, LCK, and ITK expression, we analyzed and found significant correlation of these genes with the PBMC percentage of CD4+CD28+ T cells in the replication cohort. Our results suggest that CD28, ICOS, LCK, and ITK are potential outcome biomarkers in IPF and should be further evaluated for patient prioritization for lung transplantation and stratification in drug studies.},

Three general types of models are considered, denoted L, L*, and L**, and are distinguished by which categories of the explanatory variables are directly or indirectly observed. The models have a background in two central lines of evolution in econometrics and the behavioral sciences. In another perspective of multivariate analysis, the models belong under two broad lines of evolution—from high degrees of information in the modelling to lower degrees of information. In the social sciences in the past, there has been a forceful development of causal model building by the use of path models. A new and most significant feature is that econometric methods have been incorporated in the modelling, a merger that brings together widely different lines of evolution and thereby opens up new vistas and broadens the scope of the approach. The chapter explores these developments from the point of view of NIPALS modelling. The chapter reviews causal flow models in econometrics and the behavioral sciences.},

Objectives: To uncover blood proteins associated with ILAs using large-scale proteomics methods.

The association of proteins with ILAs and ILA progression was assessed with regression modeling, as were associations with genetic risk factors. Adaptive Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator models were applied to bootstrap data samples to discover sets of proteins predictive of ILAs and their progression. Measurements and Main Results: Of 287 associations, SFTPB (surfactant protein B) (odds ratio [OR], 3.71 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 3.20-4.30]; P = 4.28 × 10-67), SCGB3A1 (Secretoglobin family 3A member 1) (OR, 2.43 [95\% CI, 2.13-2.77]; P = 8.01 × 10-40), and WFDC2 (WAP four-disulfide core domain protein 2) (OR, 2.42 [95\% CI, 2.11-2.78]; P = 4.01 × 10-36) were most significantly associated with ILA in AGES-Reykjavik and were replicated in COPDGene. In AGES-Reykjavik, concentrations of SFTPB were associated with the rs35705950 MUC5B (mucin 5B) promoter polymorphism, and SFTPB and WFDC2 had the strongest associations with ILA progression. Multivariate models of ILAs in AGES-Reykjavik, ILAs in COPDGene, and ILA progression in AGES-Reykjavik had validated areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.880, 0.826, and 0.824, respectively. Conclusions: Novel, replicated associations of ILA, its progression, and genetic risk factors with numerous blood proteins are demonstrated as well as machine-learning-based models with favorable predictive potential. Several proteins are revealed as potential markers of early fibrotic lung disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ILD) is characterised by parenchymal scar formation, leading to high morbidity and mortality. The ability to predict this phenotype remains elusive. We conducted a proteomic analysis to identify novel plasma biomarkers of progressive fibrosing ILD and developed a proteomic signature to predict this phenotype.
METHODS: Relative plasma concentrations for 368 biomarkers were determined with use of a semi-quantitative, targeted proteomic platform in patients with connective tissue disease-associated ILD, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or unclassifiable ILD who provided research blood draws at the University of California (discovery cohort) and the University of Texas (validation cohort). Univariable logistic regression was used to identify individual biomarkers associated with 1-year ILD progression, defined as death, lung transplant, or 10\% or greater relative forced vital capacity (FVC) decline. A proteomic signature of progressive fibrosing ILD was then derived with use of machine learning in the University of California cohort and validated in the University of Texas cohort.
FINDINGS: The discovery cohort comprised 385 patients (mean age 63·6 years, 59\% female) and the validation cohort comprised 204 patients (mean age 60·7 years, 61\% female). 31 biomarkers were associated with progressive fibrosing ILD in the discovery cohort, with 17 maintaining an association in the validation cohort. Validated biomarkers showed a consistent association with progressive fibrosing ILD irrespective of ILD clinical diagnosis. A proteomic signature comprising 12 biomarkers was derived by machine learning and validated in the University of Texas cohort, in which it had a sensitivity of 0·90 and corresponding negative predictive value of 0·91, suggesting that approximately 10\% of patients with a low-risk proteomic signature would experience ILD progression in the year after blood draw. Those with a low-risk proteomic signature experienced an FVC change of +85·7 mL (95\% CI 6·9 to 164·4) and those with a high-risk signature experienced an FVC change of -227·1 mL (-286·7 to -167·5). A theoretical clinical trial restricted to patients with a high-risk proteomic signature would require 80\% fewer patients than one designed without regard to proteomic signature.
INTERPRETATION: 17 plasma biomarkers of progressive fibrosing ILD were identified and showed consistent associations across ILD subtypes. A proteomic signature of progressive fibrosing ILD could enrich clinical trial cohorts and avoid the need for antecedent progression when defining progressive fibrosing ILD for clinical trial enrolment.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease in which circulatory biomarkers have the potential for guiding management in clinical practice. We assessed the prognostic role of serum biomarkers in three independent IPF cohorts: Australian Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Registry (AIPFR), Trent Lung Fibrosis (TLF) and Prospective Observation of Fibrosis in the Lung Clinical Endpoints (PROFILE).
METHODS: In the AIPFR cohort, candidate proteins were assessed by ELISA as well as in an unbiased proteomic approach. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression was used to restrict the selection of markers that best accounted for the progressor phenotype at 1 year in the AIPFR cohort, and subsequently prospectively selected for replication in the validation TLF cohort and assessed retrospectively in the PROFILE cohort. Four significantly replicating biomarkers were aggregated into a progression index model based on tertiles of circulating concentrations.
RESULTS: 189 participants were included in the AIPFR cohort, 205 participants from the TLF cohort and 122 participants from the PROFILE cohort. Differential biomarker expression was observed by ELISA and replicated for osteopontin, matrix metallopeptidase-7, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and periostin for those with a progressor phenotype at 1 year. Proteomic data did not replicate. The progression index in the AIPFR, TLF and PROFILE cohorts predicted risk of progression, mortality and progression-free survival. A statistical model incorporating the progression index demonstrated the capacity to distinguish disease progression at 12 months, which was increased beyond the clinical GAP (gender, age and physiology) score model alone in all cohorts, and significantly so within the incidence-based TLF and PROFILE cohorts.
CONCLUSION: A panel of circulatory biomarkers can provide potentially valuable clinical assistance in the prognosis of IPF patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surveys and retrospective studies of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have shown a significant diagnostic delay. However, the causes and risk factors for this delay are not known.
METHODS: Dates at six time points before the IPF diagnosis (onset of symptoms, first contact to a general practitioner, first hospital contact, referral to an interstitial lung disease (ILD) centre, first visit at an ILD centre, and final diagnosis) were recorded in a multicentre cohort of 204 incident IPF patients. Based on these dates, the delay was divided into specific patient-related and healthcare-related delays. Demographic and clinical data were used to determine risk factors for a prolonged delay, using multivariate negative binomial regression analysis.
RESULTS: The median diagnostic delay was 2.1 years (IQR: 0.9-5.0), mainly attributable to the patients, general practitioners and community hospitals. Male sex was a risk factor for patient delay (IRR: 3.84, 95\% CI: 1.17-11.36, p = 0.006) and old age was a risk factor for healthcare delay (IRR: 1.03, 95\% CI: 1.01-1.06, p = 0.004). The total delay was prolonged in previous users of inhalation therapy (IRR: 1.99, 95\% CI: 1.40-2.88, p {\textless}  0.0001) but not in patients with airway obstruction. Misdiagnosis of respiratory symptoms was reported by 41\% of all patients.
CONCLUSION: Despite increased awareness of IPF, the diagnostic delay is still 2.1 years. Male sex, older age and treatment attempts for alternative diagnoses are risk factors for a delayed diagnosis of IPF. Efforts to reduce the diagnostic delay should focus on these risk factors.

Here we summarize the current understanding of putative serum, BAL fluid, and genetic biomarkers in this setting, according to their hypothesized pathobiologic mechanisms: evidence of epithelial cell dysfunction (eg, Krebs von den Lungen-6 antigen), fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix production or turnover (eg, matrix metalloproteinase-1), or immune dysregulation (eg, CC chemokine ligand 18). While most of the available data come from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the prototypic progressive fibrosing ILD, data are available in the broader patient population of chronic fibrosing ILDs. A number of these biomarkers show promise, however, none have been validated. In this review article, we assess both the status of proposed biomarkers for chronic fibrosing lung diseases with a progressive phenotype in predicting disease risk or predisposition, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response and provide a direct comparison between IPF and other chronic fibrotic ILDs. We also reflect on the current clinical usefulness and future direction of research for biomarkers in the setting of chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Despite the availability of two drugs that are able to slow down disease progression, IPF remains a deadly disease. The pathogenesis of IPF is poorly understood, but a dysregulated wound healing response following recurrent alveolar epithelial injury is thought to be crucial.
AREAS COVERED: In the last few years, the role of the immune system in IPF pathobiology has been reconsidered; indeed, recent data suggest that a dysfunctional immune system may promote and unfavorable interplay with pro-fibrotic pathways thus acting as a cofactor in disease development and progression. In this article, we review and critically discuss the role of T cells in the pathogenesis and progression of IPF in the attempt to highlight ways in which further research in this area may enable the development of targeted immunomodulatory therapies for this dreadful disease.
EXPERT OPINION: A better understanding of T cell interactions has the potential to facilitate the development of immune modulators targeting multiple T cell-mediated pathways, thus halting disease initiation and progression.},

	abstract = {Rationale: The allergen inhalation challenge is used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of new treatments in attenuating the late-phase asthmatic response (LAR) and associated airway inflammation in subjects with allergic asthma. However, not all subjects with allergic asthma develop the LAR after allergen inhalation. Blood-based transcriptional biomarkers that can identify such individuals may help in subject recruitment for clinical trials as well as provide novel molecular insights.

Objectives: To identify blood-based transcriptional biomarker panels that can predict an individual’s response to allergen inhalation challenge.

Methods: We applied RNA sequencing to total RNA from whole blood (n = 36) collected before and after allergen challenge and generated both genome-guided and de novo datasets: genes, gene-isoforms (University of California, Santa Cruz, UCSC Genome Browser), Ensembl, and Trinity. Candidate biomarker panels were validated using the NanoString platform in an independent cohort of 33 subjects.

Measurements and Main Results: The Trinity biomarker panel consisting of known and novel biomarker transcripts had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of greater than 0.70 in both the discovery and validation cohorts. The Trinity biomarker panel was useful in predicting the response of subjects that elicited different responses (accuracy between 0.65 and 0.71) and subjects that elicit a dual response (accuracy between 0.70 and 0.75) upon repeated allergen inhalation challenges.

Conclusions: Interestingly, the biomarker panel containing novel transcripts successfully validated compared with panels with known, well-characterized genes. These biomarker–blood tests may be used to identify subjects with asthma who develop the LAR, and may also represent members of novel molecular mechanisms that can be targeted for therapy.},

Recently, the need for large longitudinal registries to study IPF has been recognised.The Australian IPF Registry (AIPFR) is a national registry collating comprehensive longitudinal data of IPF patients across Australia. We explored the characteristics of this IPF cohort and the effect of demographic and physiological parameters and specific management on mortality.Participants in the AIPFR (n=647, mean age 70.9±8.5 years, 67.7\% male, median follow up 2 years, range 6 months-4.5 years) displayed a wide range of age, disease severity and co-morbidities that is not present in clinical trial cohorts. The cumulative mortality rate in year one, two, three and four was 5\%, 24\%, 37\% and 44\% respectively. Baseline lung function (forced vital capacity, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, composite physiological index) and GAP (gender, age, physiology) stage (hazard ratio 4.64, 95\% CI 3.33-6.47, p{\textless}0.001) were strong predictors of mortality. Patients receiving anti-fibrotic medications had better survival (hazard ratio 0.56, 95\% CI 0.34-0.92, p=0.022) than those not on anti-fibrotic medications, independent of underlying disease severity.The AIPFR provides important insights into the understanding of the natural history and clinical management of IPF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease with a male predominance. Prior data suggest that male sex is associated with disease progression and survival. The basis for this sex difference is unknown.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Are there differences in clinical disease characteristics and outcomes between men and women with IPF?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two tertiary care center IPF cohorts were pooled to analyze sex differences in outcomes of time to lung transplantation or death. Predictors of outcome that were analyzed included age, FVC \% predicted, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco) \% predicted, BMI, smoking history, and respiratory variables of cough, phlegm, and need for supplemental oxygen. The associations of these factors with mortality were estimated by sex and then compared using tests for interaction.
RESULTS: There were a total of 1,263 patients in the pooled cohort with follow-up data; approximately 71\% of the patients were men. Male sex was independently associated with higher risk for death or lung transplantation after adjusting for age, FVC \% predicted, and Dlco \% predicted (hazard ratio for men, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.7; P {\textless} .001). Older age, lower Dlco \% predicted, and presence of cough or phlegm were negatively associated with transplant-free survival in men but not in women, but only the association for cough differed statistically by sex (interaction P = .007).
INTERPRETATION: Male sex is associated with worse transplant-free survival in IPF. Cough may be a sex-specific predictor of survival in this population.},

The KLRF1 gene has been localized on the high-resolution physical map of chromosome 12p. The genomic structure of the KLRF1 gene and the existence of one spliced variant are also described. KLRF1 was expressed at the mRNA level in peripheral blood leukocytes, activated NK cells, monocytes and NK and myeloid cell lines. The presence of two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory-like motifs within the cytoplasmic tail of KLRF1 suggests an inhibitory role in NK cell and monocyte activity.},

	abstract = {The ability of NK cells to kill a wide range of tumor or virally infected target cells as well as normal allogeneic T cell blasts appears to depend upon the concerted action of multiple triggering NK receptors. In this study, using two specific monoclonal antibodies [(mAb) MA152 and LAP171], we identified a triggering NK receptor expressed at the cell surface as a dimer of approximately 80 kDa (NKp80). NKp80 is expressed by virtually all fresh or activated NK cells and by a minor subset of T cells characterized by the CD56 surface antigen. NKp80 surface expression was also detected in all CD3- and in 6 / 10 CD3+ large granular lymphocyte expansions derived from patients with lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes. In polyclonal NK cells, mAb-mediated cross-linking of NKp80 resulted in induction of cytolytic activity and Ca2+ mobilization. A marked heterogeneity existed in the magnitude of the cytolytic responses of different NK cell clones to anti-NKp80 mAb. This heterogeneity correlated with the surface density of NKp46 molecules expressed by different NK clones. The mAb-mediated masking of NKp80 led to a partial inhibition of the NK-mediated lysis of appropriate allogeneic phytohemagglutinin-induced T cell blasts, while it had no effect on the lysis of different tumor target cells, including T cell leukemia cells. These data suggest that NKp80 recognizes a ligand on normal T cells that may be down-regulated during tumor transformation. Molecular cloning of the cDNA coding for NKp80 revealed a type II transmembrane molecule of 231 amino acids identical to the putative protein encoded by a recently identified cDNA termed KLRF1.},

	abstract = {Background Bladder tumor-infiltrating CD56bright NK cells are more tumor cytotoxic than their CD56dim counterparts. Identification of NK cell subsets is labor-intensive and has limited utility in the clinical setting. Here, we sought to identify a surrogate marker of bladder CD56bright NK cells and to test its prognostic significance. Methods CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells were characterized with the multiparametric flow (n = 20) and mass cytometry (n = 21) in human bladder tumors. Transcriptome data from bladder tumors (n = 351) profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed. The expression levels of individual markers in intratumoral CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells were visualized in tSNE plots. Expressions of activation markers were also compared between Killer Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily F Member 1 (KLRF1)+ and KLRF1− NK cells. Results Intratumoral CD56bright NK cells displayed a more activated phenotype compared to the CD56dim subset. Multiple intratumoral cell types expressed CD56, including bladder tumor cells and nonspecific intratumoral CD56 expression was associated with worse patient survival. Thus, an alternative to CD56 as a marker of CD56bright NK cells was sought. The activation receptor KLRF1 was significantly increased on CD56bright but not on CD56dim NK cells. Intratumoral KLRF1+ NK cells were more activated and expressed higher levels of activation molecules compared with KLRF1− NK cells, analogous to the distinct effector function of NK cells across CD56 expression. High intratumoral KLRF1 was associated with improved recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.53, p = 0.01), cancer-specific survival (HR 0.47, p = 0.02), and overall survival (HR 0.54, p = 0.02) on multivariable analyses that adjusted for clinical and pathologic variables. Conclusions KLRF1 is a promising prognostic marker in bladder cancer and may guide treatment decisions upon validation.},

While T and NK cells have been studied in SSc whole blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, their role remains unclear, partly because no studies have analysed these cell types in SSc-interstitial lung disease (ILD) lung tissue. This research aimed to identify and analyse the lymphoid subpopulations in SSc-ILD lung explants.Lymphoid populations from 13 SSc-ILD and 6 healthy control (HC) lung explants were analysed using Seurat following single-cell RNA sequencing. Lymphoid clusters were identified by their differential gene expression. Absolute cell numbers and cell proportions in each cluster were compared between cohorts. Additional analyses were performed using pathway analysis, pseudotime and cell ligand-receptor interactions.Activated CD16+ NK cells, CD8+ tissue resident memory T cells and Treg cells were proportionately higher in SSc-ILD compared with HC lungs. Activated CD16+ NK cells in SSc-ILD showed upregulated granzyme B, IFN-γ and CD226. Amphiregulin, highly upregulated by NK cells, was predicted to interact with epidermal growth factor receptor on several bronchial epithelial cell populations. Shifts in CD8+ T cell populations indicated a transition from resting to effector to tissue resident phenotypes in SSc-ILD.SSc-ILD lungs show activated lymphoid populations. Activated cytotoxic NK cells suggest they may kill alveolar epithelial cells, while their expression of amphiregulin suggests they may also induce bronchial epithelial cell hyperplasia. CD8+ T cells in SSc-ILD appear to transition from resting to the tissue resident memory phenotype.},

	abstract = {The pathophysiology of systemic sclerosis (SSc) involves early endothelial and immune activation, both preceding the onset of fibrosis. We previously identified soluble fractalkine and circulating endothelial microparticles (EMPs) as biomarkers of endothelial inflammatory activation in SSc. Fractalkine plays a dual role as a membrane-bound adhesion molecule expressed in inflamed endothelial cells (ECs) and as a chemokine involved in the recruitment, transmigration, and cytotoxic activation of immune cells that express CX3CR1, the receptor of fractalkine, namely CD8 and γδ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. We aimed to quantify circulating cytotoxic immune cells and their expression of CX3CR1. We further investigated the expression profile of NK cells chemokine receptors and activation markers and the potential of NK cells to induce EC activation in SSc. We performed a monocentric study (NCT 02636127) enrolling 15 SSc patients [15 females, median age of 55 years (39–63), 11 limited cutaneous form and 4 diffuse] and 15 healthy controls. Serum fractalkine levels were significantly increased in SSc patients. Circulating CD8 T cells numbers were decreased in SSc patients with no difference in their CX3CR1 expression. Circulating γδ T cells and NK cells numbers were preserved. CX3CR1 expression in CD8 and γδ T cells did not differ between SSc patients and controls. The percentage and level of CX3CR1 expression in NK cells were significantly lowered in SSc patients. Percentages of CXCR4, NKG2D, CD69-expressing NK cells, and their expression levels were decreased in NK cells. Conversely, CD16 level expression and percentages of CD16+ NK cells were preserved. The exposure of human microvascular dermic EC line (HMVEC-d) to peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in similar NK cells degranulation activity in SSc patients and controls. We further showed that NK cells purified from the blood of SSc patients induced enhanced release of EMPs than NK cells from controls. This study evidenced a peculiar NK cells phenotype in SSc characterized by decreased chemokine and activation receptors expression, that might reflect NK cells involvement in the pathogenic process. It also highlighted the role of NK cells as a potent mechanism inducing endothelial activation through enhanced EMPs release.},

Thus, autoimmune diseases can be classified as organ-specific or systemic. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of autoimmunity. Recent studies have demonstrated the contribution of innate immunity to the onset of autoimmune diseases. Natural killer (NK) cells, which are key components of the innate immune system, have been implicated in the development of multiple autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune liver disease. However, NK cells have both protective and pathogenic roles in autoimmunity depending on the NK cell subset, microenvironment, and disease type or stage. In this work, we review the current knowledge of the varied roles of NK cell subsets in systemic and organic-specific autoimmune diseases and their clinical potential as therapeutic targets.},

Recent studies have shown that NK cells are involved in the initiation of autoimmunity. In this study, we determined abnormalities of NK cells in systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune connective tissue disease, by assessing the frequency and absolute number, activation marker expression, cytokine production, and killing activity. The frequency and absolute number of NK cells increased in diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), whereas they were normal in limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc). NK cells from both dcSSc and lcSSc patients exhibited activated phenotypes characterized by up-regulated CD16 and CD69 expression and downregulated CD62L expression. Interferon (IFN)-gamma production by non-stimulated NK cells from both dcSSc and lcSSc patients was increased compared to the normal control, whereas on stimulation, a reduced amount of IFN-gamma was produced. Interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-10 production by non-stimulated NK cells and IL-6 production by stimulated NK cells were augmented in dcSSc patients, but not in lcSSc patients. Despite the augmented cytokine production by non-stimulated NK cells, natural cytotoxicity activity and granzyme B secretion was reduced in NK cells from dcSSc and lcSSc patients.

	abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan, versican increases along with other ECM versican binding molecules such as hyaluronan, tumor necrosis factor stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), and inter alpha trypsin inhibitor (IαI) during inflammation in a number of different diseases such as cardiovascular and lung disease, autoimmune diseases, and several different cancers. These interactions form stable scaffolds which can act as “landing strips” for inflammatory cells as they invade tissue from the circulation. The increase in versican is often coincident with the invasion of leukocytes early in the inflammatory process. Versican interacts with inflammatory cells either indirectly via hyaluronan or directly via receptors such as CD44, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), and toll-like receptors (TLRs) present on the surface of immune and non-immune cells. These interactions activate signaling pathways that promote the synthesis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-6, and NFκB. Versican also influences inflammation by interacting with a variety of growth factors and cytokines involved in regulating inflammation thereby influencing their bioavailability and bioactivity. Versican is produced by multiple cell types involved in the inflammatory process. Conditional total knockout of versican in a mouse model of lung inflammation demonstrated significant reduction in leukocyte invasion into the lung and reduced inflammatory cytokine expression. While versican produced by stromal cells tends to be pro-inflammatory, versican expressed by myeloid cells can create anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironments. Inflammation in the tumor microenvironment often contains elevated levels of versican. Perturbing the accumulation of versican in tumors can inhibit inflammation and tumor progression in some cancers. Thus versican, as a component of the ECM impacts immunity and inflammation through regulating immune cell trafficking and activation. Versican is emerging as a potential target in the control of inflammation in a number of different diseases.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains a truly idiopathic fibrotic disease, with a modest genetic predilection and candidate triggers but no overall explanation for the development of disease in non-familial cases. Agreement on terminology has contributed to major clinical and translational advances since the millennium. It is likely that the entity currently captured by the term “IPF” will be radically reclassified over the next decade, either through “splitting” (into IPF subgroups responding selectively to individual disease-modifying agents) or through “lumping” of IPF with other forms of progressive fibrotic lung disease (with shared pathogenetic mechanisms and IPF-like disease behaviour). In this perspective, we summarise the clinical and pathogenetic justification for a focus on “the progressive fibrotic phenotype” in future clinical and translational research. By this means, we can hope to address the needs of non-IPF patients with inexorably progressive fibrotic disease, currently disenfranchised by lack of access to agents that are efficacious in IPF. In this regard, ongoing trials of anti-fibrotic therapies in non-IPF patients with progressive fibrosis may be highly influential. Future revision of IPF nomenclature may be warranted if there are major conceptual changes but without compelling justification, the benefits of renaming IPF are likely to be outweighed by the resulting confusion.

Centonze et al. identify LTK as the first ER-resident receptor tyrosine kinase and show that it stimulates secretory trafficking out of the ER., The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a key regulator of cellular proteostasis because it controls folding, sorting, and degradation of secretory proteins. Much has been learned about how environmentally triggered signaling pathways regulate ER function, but only little is known about local signaling at the ER. The identification of ER-resident signaling molecules will help gain a deeper understanding of the regulation of ER function and thus of proteostasis. Here, we show that leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) is an ER-resident receptor tyrosine kinase. Depletion of LTK as well as its pharmacologic inhibition reduces the number of ER exit sites and slows ER-to-Golgi transport. Furthermore, we show that LTK interacts with and phosphorylates Sec12. Expression of a phosphoablating mutant of Sec12 reduces the efficiency of ER export. Thus, LTK-to-Sec12 signaling represents the first example of an ER-resident signaling module with the potential to regulate proteostasis.},

	abstract = {Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a complex multigenic disease, is a typical antibody-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by production of autoantibodies against a variety of autoantigens and immune complex-type tissue inflammation, most prominently in the kidney. Evidence suggests that genetic factors predisposing to aberrant proliferation/maturation of self-reactive B cells initiate and propagate the disease. In SLE-prone New Zealand Black (NZB) mice and their F1 cross with New Zealand White (NZW) mice, B cell abnormalities can be ascribed mainly to self-reactive CD5+ B1 cells. Our genome-wide scans to search for susceptibility genes for aberrant activation of B1 cells in these mice showed evidence that the gene, Ltk, encoding leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK), is a possible candidate. LTK is a receptor-type protein tyrosine kinase, belonging to the insulin receptor superfamily, and is mainly expressed in B lymphocyte precursors and neuronal tissues. Sequence and functional analyses of the gene revealed that NZB has a gain-of-function polymorphism in the LTK kinase domain near YXXM, a binding motif of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). SLE patients also had this type of Ltk polymorphism with a significantly higher frequency compared with the healthy controls. Our findings suggest that these polymorphic LTKs cause up-regulation of the PI3K pathway and possibly form one genetic component of susceptibility to abnormal proliferation of self-reactive B cells in SLE.},

	abstract = {Rationale: There is growing evidence that resident cells, such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells, can drive the persistent accumulation of dendritic cells (DCs) in chronically inflamed tissue, leading to the organization and the maintenance of ectopic lymphoid aggregates. This phenomenon, occurring through a chemokine-mediated retention mechanism, has been documented in various disorders, but not in fibrotic interstitial lung disorders in which the presence of organized lymphoid follicles has been documented.

Objectives: To characterize the distribution of DCs in fibrotic lung, and to analyze the expression of the main chemokines known to regulate DC recruitment.

Methods: Lung resection tissue (lungs with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; n = 12; lungs with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, n = 5; control lungs, n = 5) was snap-frozen for subsequent immunohistochemical techniques on serial sections and reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction analysis.

Measurements and Main Results: Results were similar in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia lungs, which were heavily infiltrated by immature DCs in established fibrosis and in areas of epithelial hyperplasia. Altered epithelial cells and fibroblasts, particularly in fibroblastic foci, frankly expressed all chemokines (CCL19, CCL20, CCL22, and CXCL12) susceptible to favor the recruitment of immune cells. Lymphoid follicles were infiltrated by maturing DCs, which could originate from the pool of DCs accumulating in their vicinity.

Conclusions: These findings suggest that resident cells in pulmonary fibrosis can sustain chronic inflammation by driving the accumulation of DCs with the potential to mature locally within ectopic lymphoid follicles. Future strategies should consider DCs or chemokines as therapeutic targets in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.},

Type I interferonopathies refer to rare Mendelian genetic disorders such as Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS) as well as more frequent and polygenic auto-immune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Yet, detection of type I IFN in these patients remains challenging as its amount is usually very low in patients' sera. Thus, the detection of interferon-stimulating genes has been proposed as an alternative for the detection of this cytokine but sensitivy, specificity and predictive values of the assay have not been reported so far. In this study, we propose two different methods based on Nanostring or RT-qPCR to measure in the clinical routine the IFN response, defined as a set of transcripts that are systemically induced by IFNs. The IFN signature is composed of 6 IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) and has a strong predictive value for the diagnosis of type I interferonopathies. The use of this simple test might represent a gold standard for the evaluation of various autoimmune diseases. Moreover, this test could also be used to monitor patients treated with drugs targeting type I IFN pathway. When comparing both methods - Nanostring and qPCR - in terms of analytical performance, they provided similar results but Nanostring was quicker, easier to multiplex, and almost fully-automated, which represent a more reliable assay for the daily clinical practice.},

Expression of the CX3CL1 gene, whose expression product is the sole ligand for CX3CR1, is up-regulated in human lungs with chronic cigarette smoke-induced obstructive lung disease. At present, it is unknown whether CX3CL1 up-regulation is associated with the recruitment and accumulation of immune cells that express CX3CR1. We show that mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke up-regulate CX3CL1 gene expression, which is associated with an influx of CX3CR1+ cells in the lungs. The increase in CX3CR1+ cells is primarily comprised of macrophages and T lymphocytes and is associated with the development of emphysema. In alveolar macrophages, cigarette smoke exposure increased the expression of both CX3CR1 and CX3CL1 genes. The inducibility of CX3CR1 expression was not solely dependent on a chronic stimulus because lipopolysaccharide up-regulated CX3CR1 in RAW264.7 cells in vitro and in mononuclear phagocytes in vivo. Our findings suggest a mechanism by which macrophages amplify and promote CX3CR1+ cell accumulation within the lungs during both acute and chronic inflammatory stress. We suggest that one function of the CX3CR1-CX3CL1 pathway is to recruit and sustain divergent immune cell populations implicated in the pathogenesis of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema.},

The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms have been the focus of extensive research in the past. The lung has a complex architecture, where structural cells interact continuously with immune cells that infiltrate into the pulmonary tissue. Both types of cells express chemokines and chemokine receptors, making them sensitive to modifications of concentration gradients. Cigarette smoke exposure and recurrent exacerbations, directly and indirectly, impact the expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors. Here, we provide an overview of the evidence regarding chemokines involvement in COPD, and we hypothesize that a dysregulation of this tightly regulated system is critical in COPD evolution, both at a stable state and during exacerbations. Targeting chemokines and chemokine receptors could be highly attractive as a mean to control both chronic inflammation and bronchial remodeling. We present a special focus on the CXCL8-CXCR1/2, CXCL9/10/11-CXCR3, CCL2-CCR2, and CXCL12-CXCR4 axes that seem particularly involved in the disease pathophysiology.},

The expression of TSPAN1 was decreased and associated with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1 )-induced molecular characteristics of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Silencing TSPAN1 promoted cell migration, and the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, vimentin and E-cadherin in AECs with TGF-β1 treatment, while exogenous TSPAN1 has the converse effects. Moreover, silencing TSPAN1 promotes the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and stabilizes beta-catenin protein, however, overexpressed TSPAN1 impeded TGF-β1 -induced activation of Smad2/3 and beta-catenin pathway in AECs.

	abstract = {B-cell activation is increasingly linked to numerous fibrotic lung diseases, and it is well known that aggregates of lymphocytes form in the lung of many of these patients. Activation of B-cells by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) drives the release of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases important in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis. However, the specific mechanisms of B-cell activation in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are poorly understood. Herein, we have demonstrated that B-cell activation by microbial antigens contributes to the inflammatory and profibrotic milieu seen in patients with IPF. B-cell stimulation by CpG and β-glucan via PRRs resulted in activation of mTOR-dependent and independent pathways. Moreover, we showed that the B-cell–secreted inflammatory milieu is specific to the inducing antigen and causes differential fibroblast migration and activation. B-cell responses to infectious agents and subsequent B-cell–mediated fibroblast activation are modifiable by antifibrotics, but each seems to exert a specific and different effect. These results suggest that, upon PRR activation by microbial antigens, B-cells can contribute to the inflammatory and fibrotic changes seen in patients with IPF, and antifibrotics are able to at least partially reverse these responses.},

	abstract = {Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial pneumonia causing a loss of respiratory surface area due to a proliferative fibrotic response involving hyperplastic, hypertrophic, and metaplastic epithelium, cystic honeycomb change, septal expansion, and variable inflammation. Wnt (wingless) signaling glycoproteins are known to be involved in lung development and tissue repair, and are up-regulated in patients with IPF. Based on previous qRT-PCR data showing increased Wnt7B in lungs of IPF patients, a systematic, quantitative examination of its tissue site distribution was undertaken.

Methods
Tissue samples from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) of 39 patients diagnosed with mild to severe IPF/usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and 19 normal patients were examined for the immunolocalization of Wnt7B.

Results
In normal lung, moderate Wnt7B reactivity was confined to airway epithelium, smooth muscle of airways and vasculature, and macrophages. IPF lung showed strong Wnt7B reactivity in fibroblastic foci, dysplastic airway and alveolar epithelium, and in highly discrete subepithelial, basement membrane-associated regions. All reactive sites were sized and counted relative to specific microscopic regions. Those in the subepithelial sites were found in significantly greater numbers and larger relative area compared with the others. No reactive sites were present in normal patient controls.

Conclusions
The results demonstrate Wnt7B to be expressed at high concentrations in regions of active hyperplasia, metaplasia, and fibrotic change in IPF patients. In this context and its previously established biologic activities, Wnt7B would be expected to be of potential importance in the pathogenesis of IPF.},

Recent studies suggested that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a major regulator of epigenetic repression, played an important role in the occurrence and development of fibrosis through gene silencing or transcriptional activation. As the most studied and powerful pro-fibrotic cytokine closely related to EZH2, TGF-β1 was primarily involved in the regulation of fibrosis along with the typical Smads and non-Smads signaling pathways. In addition, EZH2 inhibitors demonstrated inhibitory effects in several types of fibrosis. This review summarized the relationship underlying the action of EZH2, TGF-β1/Smads, and TGF-β1/non-Smads with fibrosis and described the research progress of EZH2 inhibitors in the treatment of fibrosis.},

The inhibition of EZH2 by its inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) or an shRNA reduced the TGF-β1-induced differentiation of human lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, as demonstrated by the expression of the myofibroblast markers α-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin, and contractility. DZNep inhibited Smad2/3 nuclear translocation without affecting Smad2/3 phosphorylation. DZNep treatment attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.

To gain insight into the pathogenesis of IPF, we reanalyzed our previously published gene expression data profiling IPF lungs. Cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1) was among the most highly up-regulated genes in IPF lungs, compared with normal controls. The protein product (CLF-1) and its partner, cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC), function as members of the interleukin 6 (IL-6) family of cytokines. Because of earlier work implicating IL-6 family members in IPF pathogenesis, we tested whether CLF-1 expression contributes to inflammation in experimental pulmonary fibrosis. In IPF, we detected CLF-1 expression in both type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. We found that the receptor for CLF-1/CLC signaling, ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR), was expressed only in type II alveolar epithelial cells. Administration of CLF-1/CLC to both uninjured and bleomycin-injured mice led to the pulmonary accumulation of CD4(+) T cells. We also found that CLF-1/CLC administration increased inflammation but decreased pulmonary fibrosis. CLF-1/CLC leads to significantly enriched expression of T-cell-derived chemokines and cytokines, including the antifibrotic cytokine interferon-γ. We propose that, in IPF, CLF-1 is a selective stimulus of type II alveolar epithelial cells and may potentially drive an antifibrotic response by augmenting both T-helper-1-driven and T-regulatory-cell-driven inflammatory responses in the lung.},

The performance of available biclustering algorithms heavily depends on individual parameterization and varies with their application. Here, we developed MoSBi (molecular signature identification using biclustering), an automated multialgorithm ensemble approach that integrates results utilizing an error model-supported similarity network. We systematically evaluated the performance of 11 available and established biclustering algorithms together with MoSBi. For this, we used transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data, as well as synthetic datasets covering various data properties. Profiting from multialgorithm integration, MoSBi identified robust group and disease-specific signatures across all scenarios, overcoming single algorithm specificities. Furthermore, we developed a scalable network-based visualization of bicluster communities that supports biological hypothesis generation. MoSBi is available as an R package and web service to make automated biclustering analysis accessible for application in molecular sample stratification.},

However, identifying biologically significant and reproducible sets of genes and samples remain challenging for the existing tools. Many recent studies have shown that the integration of gene expression and protein interaction data improves the robustness of prediction and classification and advances biomarker discovery.Here, we present DESMOND, a new method for identification of Differentially ExpreSsed gene MOdules iN Diseases. DESMOND performs network-constrained biclustering on gene expression data and identifies gene modules—connected sets of genes up- or down-regulated in subsets of samples. We applied DESMOND on expression profiles of samples from two large breast cancer cohorts and have shown that the capability of DESMOND to incorporate protein interactions allows identifying the biologically meaningful gene and sample subsets and improves the reproducibility of the results.https://github.com/ozolotareva/DESMOND.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Nearly 40\% of annotated lncRNAs are transcribed in antisense direction to other genes and have often been implicated in their regulation via transcript- or transcription-dependent mechanisms. However, it remains unclear whether inverse correlation of gene expression would generally point toward a regulatory interaction between the genes. Here, we profiled lncRNA and mRNA expression in lung and liver cancer cells after exposure to DNA damage. Our analysis revealed two pairs of mRNA-lncRNA sense-antisense transcripts being inversely expressed upon DNA damage. The lncRNA NOP14-AS1 was strongly upregulated upon DNA damage, while the mRNA for NOP14 was downregulated, both in a p53-dependent manner. For another pair, the lncRNA LIPE-AS1 was downregulated, while its antisense mRNA CEACAM1 was upregulated. To test whether as expected the antisense genes would regulate each other resulting in this highly significant inverse correlation, we employed antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi to study transcript-dependent effects as well as dCas9-based transcriptional modulation by CRISPRi/CRISPRa for transcription-dependent effects. Surprisingly, despite the strong stimulus-dependent inverse correlation, our data indicate that neither transcript- nor transcription-dependent mechanisms explain the inverse regulation of NOP14-AS1:NOP14 or LIPE-AS1:CEACAM1 expression. Hence, sense-antisense pairs whose expression is strongly—positively or negatively—correlated can be nonetheless regulated independently. This highlights the requirement of individual experimental studies for each antisense pair and prohibits drawing conclusions on regulatory mechanisms from expression correlations.},

Myositis-associated interstitial lung disease (MA-ILD) is associated with increased mortality, but no prognostic model exists in this population. The ILD-GAP index was developed to predict mortality risk across all subtypes of chronic ILD. The purpose of this study was to validate the ILD-GAP risk prediction model in patients with MA-ILD.
Procedures
We completed a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients enrolled in the Johns Hopkins Myositis Center database between 2006 and 2017. Cumulative mortality rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier test. Model calibration was determined by using standardized mortality ratios of observed versus expected deaths.
Main findings
179 participants with MA-ILD were included. The mean baseline percent predicted forced vital capacity was 65.2 ± 20.6\%, forced expiratory volume in the first second 65.4 ± 20.4\%, and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity 61.6 ± 20.0\%. Thirty-two participants died (17.9\%). The ILD-GAP model had poor discriminative performance and calibration.
Conclusions
The ILD-GAP risk prediction model is a poor predictor of mortality among individuals with MA-ILD. The identification of a better predictive model for MA-ILD is needed to help guide care in this patient population.},

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were proposed as novel tumor prognostic markers, including for predicting bladder cancer progression, and the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis conceived an accessible entry point to discover potential lncRNA candidates. This study indicated that LINC02470 promotes bladder cancer cell viability, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumorigenicity by sponging miR-143-3p and consequently rescuing SMAD3 translation to activate the TGF-β-induced EMT process. These data demonstrate that the LINC02470–miR-143-3p–SMAD3 ceRNA axis directly regulates the major transcription factor of TGF-β signaling, SMAD3, thereby inducing the EMT process in bladder cancer and enhancing the aggressiveness of bladder cancer cells.

Abstract
Bladder cancer progression and metastasis have become major threats in clinical practice, increasing mortality and therapeutic refractoriness; recently, epigenetic dysregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related signaling pathways has been explored. However, research in the fields of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulation in bladder cancer progression is just beginning. This study was designed to determine potential EMT-related ceRNA regulation in bladder cancer progression and elucidate the underlying mechanisms that provoke aggressiveness. After screening the intersection of bioinformatic pipelines, LINC02470 was identified as the most upregulated lncRNA during bladder cancer initiation and progression. Both in vitro and in vivo biological effects indicated that LINC02470 promotes bladder cancer cell viability, migration, invasion, and tumorigenicity. On a molecular level, miR-143-3p directly targets and reduces both LINC02470 and SMAD3 RNA expression. Therefore, the LINC02470–miR-143-3p–SMAD3 ceRNA axis rescues SMAD3 translation upon LINC02470 sponging miR-143-3p, and SMAD3 consequently activates the TGF-β-induced EMT process. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that LINC02470 plays a pivotally regulatory role in the promotion of TGF-β-induced EMT through the miR-143-3p/SMAD3 axis, thereby aggravating bladder cancer progression. Our study warrants further investigation of LINC02470 as an indicatively prognostic marker of bladder cancer.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a devastating, fibroproliferative, chronic lung disorder, is associated with expansion of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, which leads to excessive production and deposition of extracellular matrix. IPF is typically clinically identified as end-stage lung disease, after fibrotic processes are well-established and advanced. Fibroblasts have been shown to be critically important in the development and progression of IPF. We hypothesize that differential chromatin access can drive genetic differences in IPF fibroblasts relative to healthy fibroblasts. To this end, we performed assay of transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing to identify differentially accessible regions within the genomes of fibroblasts from healthy and IPF lungs. Multiple motifs were identified to be enriched in IPF fibroblasts compared with healthy fibroblasts, including binding motifs for TWIST1 and FOXA1. RNA sequencing identified 93 genes that could be annotated to differentially accessible regions. Pathway analysis of the annotated genes identified cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal anchoring, and cell differentiation as important biological processes. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis showed that linkage disequilibrium blocks of IPF risk single nucleotide polymorphisms with IPF-accessible regions that have been identified to be located in genes that are important in IPF, including MUC5B, TERT, and TOLLIP. Validation studies in isolated lung tissue confirmed increased expression for TWIST1 and FOXA1 in addition to revealing SHANK2 and CSPR2 as novel targets. Thus, modulation of differential chromatin access may be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis.},

Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic component of a multiprotein complex, polycomb repressive complex 2, which is involved in the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. In this study, we investigated the role and mechanisms of EZH2 in the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. We found that EZH2 was upregulated in the lungs of patients with IPF and in mice with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. The upregulation of EZH2 occurred in myofibroblasts. The inhibition of EZH2 by its inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) or an shRNA reduced the TGF-β1-induced differentiation of human lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, as demonstrated by the expression of the myofibroblast markers α-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin, and contractility. DZNep inhibited Smad2/3 nuclear translocation without affecting Smad2/3 phosphorylation. DZNep treatment attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. We conclude that EZH2 induces the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts by enhancing Smad2/3 nuclear translocation.},

	abstract = {Killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR)2DL4 (2DL4, CD158d) was previously described as the only KIR expressed by every human NK cell. It is also structurally atypical among KIRs because it possesses a basic transmembrane residue, which is characteristic of many activating receptors, but also contains a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). We expressed epitope-tagged 2DL4 in an NK-like cell line to study receptor function. Three distinct 2DL4 cDNA clones were analyzed: one encoding the "conventional" 2DL4 with the cytoplasmic ITIM (2DL4.1) and two encoding different cytoplasmic truncated forms lacking the ITIM (2DL4.2 and 2DL4(*)). Surprisingly, one truncated receptor (2DL4.2), which is the product of a prevalent human 2DL4 allele, was not expressed on the cell surface, indicating that some individuals may lack functional 2DL4 protein expression. Conversely, both 2DL4.1 and 2DL4(*) were expressed on the cell surface and up-regulated by IL-2. Analysis of primary NK cells with anti-2DL4 mAb confirmed the lack of surface expression in a donor with the 2DL4.2 genotype. Donors with the 2DL4.1 genotype occasionally expressed receptor only on CD56(high) NK cells, although their expression was up-regulated by IL-2. Interestingly, Ab engagement of epitope-tagged 2DL4 triggered rapid and robust IFN-gamma production, but weak redirected cytotoxicity in an NK-like cell line, which was the opposite pattern to that observed upon engagement of another NK cell activating receptor, NKp44. Importantly, both 2DL4.1 and 2DL4(*) exhibited similar activation potential, indicating that the ITIM does not influence 2DL4.1 activating function. The unique activation properties of 2DL4 suggest linkage to a distinct signaling pathway.},

	abstract = {The function of the FAM83F protein, like the functions of many members of the FAM83 family, is poorly understood. Here, we show that injection of Fam83f mRNA into Xenopus embryos causes axis duplication, a phenotype indicative of enhanced Wnt signalling. Consistent with this, overexpression of FAM83F activates Wnt signalling, whereas ablation of FAM83F from human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells attenuates it. We demonstrate that FAM83F is farnesylated and interacts and co-localises with CK1α at the plasma membrane. This interaction with CK1α is essential for FAM83F to activate Wnt signalling, and FAM83F mutants that do not interact with CK1α fail to induce axis duplication in Xenopus embryos and to activate Wnt signalling in cells. FAM83F acts upstream of GSK-3β because the attenuation of Wnt signalling caused by loss of FAM83F can be rescued by GSK-3 inhibition. Introduction of a farnesyl-deficient mutant of FAM83F in cells through CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing redirects the FAM83F-CK1α complex away from the plasma membrane and significantly attenuates Wnt signalling, indicating that FAM83F exerts its effects on Wnt signalling at the plasma membrane.},

Long noncoding RNAs are considered to take part in cellular phenotypes and are emerging as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of glioma. This study will research the effects of Small Nucleolar RNA Host Gene 5 (SNHG5) gene on malignant cellular phenotypes in glioma and explore the possible mechanisms., Materials and Methods: The expression level of SNHG5 was examined using quantitative Real-time PCR in glioma tissues and cell lines. Loss-of-function experiments of SNHG5 together with Enhanced Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry and cell invasion assay were used to investigate the effects of SNHG5 on malignant cellular phenotypes of glioma cells. Finally, luciferase assay and western blotting were applied to determine the activity of WNT/CTNNB1 signaling pathway., Results: SNHG5 gene was high-expressed in glioma tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of SNHG5 gene depressed cell proliferation and invasiveness as well as promoted the apoptosis of U251 and U87 cells. In addition, online database analysis showed SNHG5 was closely related to Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling pathway. Knockdown of SNHG5 inactivated Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling pathway, and the activating of Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling pathway partly restored the influences of SNHG5 knockdown on malignant cellular phenotypes of U251 and U87 cells., Conclusion: SNHG5 gene was high-expressed in glioma, knockdown of SNHG5 inhibits malignant cellular phenotypes of glioma via Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling pathway.},

Here we show that an ER protein disulfide isomerase, thioredoxin domain containing 5 (TXNDC5), is highly upregulated in the lung tissues from both patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and a mouse model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF. Global deletion of Txndc5 markedly reduces the extent of PF and preserves lung function in mice following BLM treatment. Mechanistic investigations demonstrate that TXNDC5 promotes fibrogenesis by enhancing TGFβ1 signaling through direct binding with and stabilization of TGFBR1 in lung fibroblasts. Moreover, TGFβ1 stimulation is shown to upregulate TXNDC5 via ER stress/ATF6-dependent transcriptional control in lung fibroblasts. Inducing fibroblast-specific deletion of Txndc5 mitigates the progression of BLM-induced PF and lung function deterioration. Targeting TXNDC5, therefore, could be a novel therapeutic approach against PF.},

	abstract = {The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential event during cell development, in which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal fibroblast-like features including reduced intercellular adhesion and increased motility. EMT also plays a key role in wound healing processes, which are mediated by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts. These cells secrete specific factors that interact with molecules of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as collagens, laminins, elastin and tenascins. Wound healing follows four distinct and successive phases characterized by haemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation and finally tissue remodeling. EMT is classified into three diverse subtypes: type-1 EMT, type-2 EMT and type-3 EMT. Type-1 EMT is involved in embryogenesis and organ development. Type-2 EMT is associated with wound healing, tissue regeneration and organ fibrosis. During organ fibrosis, type-2 EMT occurs as a reparative-associated process in response to ongoing inflammation and eventually leads to organ destruction. Type-3 EMT is implicated in cancer progression, which is linked to the occurrence of genetic and epigenetic alterations, in detail the ones promoting clonal outgrowth and the formation of localized tumors. The current review aimed at exploring the role of EMT process with particular focus on type-2 EMT in wound healing, fibrosis and tissue regeneration, as well as some recent progresses in the EMT and tissue regeneration field, including the modulation of EMT by biomaterials.},

	abstract = {IPF is characterized by fibroblast accumulation, collagen deposition, and ECM remodeling, with myofibroblasts believed to be the effector cell type. Myofibroblasts develop due to EMT of lung alveolar epithelial cells, which can be induced by TGF-β. M2 macrophages, a macrophage subpopulation, secrete large amounts of TGF-β. To clarify the relationship between IPF, EMT, TGF-β, and M2 macrophages, a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model was used. Seventeen days after mice were treated with bleomycin, the successful establishment of a pulmonary fibrosis model was confirmed by HE stain and Masson's trichrome stain. We found evidence in support of EMT, such as elevated protein levels of α-SMA in lung tissue and decreased levels of E-cadherin and CK-18. Additionally, increased TGF-β levels and TGF-β/Smad2 signaling activation was observed. Macrophages were recruited to pulmonary alveoli. Alveolar macrophages were phenotyped and identified as M2 macrophages, with up-regulated CD206 on the cell surfaces. For in vitro studies, we treated RAW 264.7 cells with IL-4 for 24 h, and the cells were then utilized as M2 macrophages. TGF-β levels increased significantly in the culture supernatant. Forty-eight hours after lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) were co-cultured with the M2 macrophages, the expression of α-SMA increased, and E-cadherin and CK-18 decreased. When a TGF-β receptor inhibitor, LY2109761 was used, the EMT induced by M2 macrophages was blocked. In conclusion, we demonstrated that M2 macrophages induce EMT through the TGF-β/Smad2 signaling pathway.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: The interstitial lung disease (ILD) specialists in Vancouver participate in a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) that is primarily used internally for patients seen by these specialists. The MDD is also used remotely (externally) by general pulmonologists to increase access to this service.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the impact of an MDD on the diagnosis and management of ILD in these two patient cohorts, and to report the satisfaction of referring pulmonologists with this service.
METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included patients who underwent MDD review between March 2014 and June 2017. Data were extracted from standardized MDD records and comparisons were made between the internal and external ILD cohorts. Pulmonologists who used the external review service completed an anonymous survey addressing their satisfaction with components of the MDD.
RESULTS: The 209 internal patients and 91 external patients had similar clinical characteristics. MDD review led to a change in diagnosis in 40\% of patients, including 36\% of internal patients and 48\% of external patients (P = 0.04). For patients without a working diagnosis, 44\% were provided a confident ILD diagnosis following MDD, including 78\% of patients with a surgical lung biopsy and 37\% of patients without a surgical lung biopsy (P {\textless} 0.001). After MDD review, treatment was started in 45\% of patients on no ILD therapy, and treatment was changed in 45\% of patients on ILD therapy. Overall, 93\% of the 14 respondents (out of 16 surveyed) were very or somewhat satisfied with the MDD external review service.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar to previous publications, our study suggests an important role of MDD in the diagnosis and management of ILD, and further demonstrates that MDD of external patients is a viable service that allows greater and more rapid access to ILD expertise.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is often initially misdiagnosed. Delays in accessing subspecialty care could lead to worse outcomes among those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between delayed access to subspecialty care and survival time in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 129 adults who met American Thoracic Society criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis evaluated at a tertiary care center. Delay was defined as the time from the onset of dyspnea to the date of initial evaluation at a tertiary care center. We used competing risk survival methods to examine survival time and time to transplantation.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean age was 63 years and 76\% were men. The median delay was 2.2 years (interquartile range 1.0–3.8 yr), and the median follow-up time was 1.1 years. Age and lung function at the time of evaluation did not vary by delay. A longer delay was associated with an increased risk of death independent of age, sex, forced vital capacity, third-party payer, and educational attainment (adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of delay was 1.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.6). Longer delay was not associated with a lower likelihood of undergoing lung transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS: Delayed access to a tertiary care center is associated with a higher mortality rate in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis independent of disease severity. Early referral to a specialty center should be considered for those with known or suspected interstitial lung disease.},

	abstract = {Fibrosis can develop in most organs and causes organ failure. The most common type of lung fibrosis is known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in which fibrosis starts at the lung periphery and then progresses toward the lung center, eventually causing respiratory failure. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and periphery-to-center progression of the disease. Here we discovered that loss of Cdc42 function in alveolar stem cells (AT2 cells) causes periphery-to-center progressive lung fibrosis. We further show that Cdc42-null AT2 cells in both post-pneumonectomy and untreated aged mice cannot regenerate new alveoli, resulting in sustained exposure of AT2 cells to elevated mechanical tension. We demonstrate that elevated mechanical tension activates a TGF-β signaling loop in AT2 cells, which drives the periphery-to-center progression of lung fibrosis. Our study establishes a direct mechanistic link between impaired alveolar regeneration, mechanical tension, and progressive lung fibrosis.},

	abstract = {This expert group consensus statement emphasises the need for standardising the definition of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (F-ILDs), with an accurate initial diagnosis being of paramount importance in ensuring appropriate initial management. Equally, case-by-case decisions on monitoring and management are essential, given the varying presentations of F-ILDs and the varying rates of progression. The value of diagnostic tests in risk stratification at presentation and, separately, the importance of a logical monitoring strategy, tailored to manage the risk of progression, are also stressed. The term “progressive pulmonary fibrosis” (PPF) exactly describes the entity that clinicians often face in practice. The importance of using antifibrotic therapy early in PPF (once initial management has failed to prevent progression) is increasingly supported by evidence. Artificial intelligence software for high-resolution computed tomography analysis, although an exciting tool for the future, awaits validation. Guidance is provided on pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen and the use of non-invasive ventilation focused specifically on the needs of ILD patients with progressive disease. PPF should be differentiated from acute deterioration due to drug-induced lung toxicity or other forms of acute exacerbations. Referral criteria for a lung transplant are discussed and applied to patient needs in severe diseases where transplantation is not realistic, either due to access limitations or transplantation contraindications. In conclusion, expert group consensus guidance is provided on the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of F-ILDs with specific focus on the recognition of PPF and the management of pulmonary fibrosis progressing despite initial management.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The development of clinically progressive fibrosis complicates a wide array of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). However, there are limited data regarding its prevalence and prognosis.
METHODS: We analysed consecutive patients seen for initial evaluation of a fibrosing form of ILD (FILD). Patients were evaluated for evidence of progressive fibrosis over the first 24 months of follow-up. We defined a progressive phenotype as the presence of at least one of the following: a relative decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≥10\%; a relative decline in FVC of ≥5\%-{\textless}10\% with a relative decline in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide of ≥15\%, increased fibrosis on HRCT or progressive symptoms.
RESULTS: Eight hundred and forty-four patients (397 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF] and 447 non-IPF FILD) made up the final analysis cohort. Three hundred and fifty-five patients (42.1\%) met the progressive phenotype criteria (59.4\% of IPF patients and 26.6\% of non-IPF FILD patients, p {\textless}0.01). In both IPF and non-IPF FILD, transplantation-free survival differed between patients with a progressive phenotype and those without (p {\textless}0.01). Multivariable analysis showed that a progressive phenotype was an independent predictor of transplantation-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.36, 95\% CI: 2.68-4.23, p {\textless}0.01). Transplantation-free survival did not differ between non-IPF FILD with a progressive phenotype and IPF (HR: 1.12, 95\% CI: 0.85-1.48, p = 0.42).
CONCLUSION: Over one-fourth of non-IPF FILD patients develop a progressive phenotype compared to approximately 60\% of IPF patients. The survival of non-IPF FILD patients with a progressive phenotype is similar to IPF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD) is characterised by progressive physiological, symptomatic and/or radiographic worsening. The real-world prevalence and characteristics of PF-ILD remain uncertain.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled from the Canadian Registry for Pulmonary Fibrosis between 2015 and 2020. PF-ILD was defined as a relative forced vital capacity (FVC) decline ≥10\%, death, lung transplantation or any two of: relative FVC decline ≥5\% and {\textless}10\%, worsening respiratory symptoms or worsening fibrosis on computed tomography of the chest, all within 24 months of diagnosis. Time-to-event analysis compared progression between key diagnostic subgroups. Characteristics associated with progression were determined by multivariable regression.
RESULTS: Of 2746 patients with fibrotic ILD (mean±sd age 65±12 years; 51\% female), 1376 (50\%) met PF-ILD criteria in the first 24 months of follow-up. PF-ILD occurred in 427 (59\%) patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 125 (58\%) with fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), 281 (51\%) with unclassifiable ILD (U-ILD) and 402 (45\%) with connective tissue disease-associated ILD (CTD-ILD). Compared with IPF, time to progression was similar in patients with HP (hazard ratio (HR) 0.96, 95\% CI 0.79-1.17), but was delayed in patients with U-ILD (HR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.71-0.96) and CTD-ILD (HR 0.65, 95\% CI 0.56-0.74). Background treatment varied across diagnostic subtypes, with 66\% of IPF patients receiving antifibrotic therapy, while immunomodulatory therapy was utilised in 49\%, 61\% and 37\% of patients with CHP, CTD-ILD and U-ILD, respectively. Increasing age, male sex, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and lower baseline pulmonary function were independently associated with progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Progression is common in patients with fibrotic ILD, and is similarly prevalent in HP and IPF. Routinely collected variables help identify patients at risk for progression and may guide therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proposed criteria for progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD) have been linked to increased mortality risk, but lung function trajectory after satisfying individual criteria remains unknown. Because survival is rarely employed as the primary end-point in therapeutic trials, identifying PF-ILD criteria that best predict subsequent change in forced vital capacity (FVC) could improve clinical trial design.
METHODS: A retrospective, multicentre longitudinal cohort analysis was performed in consecutive patients with fibrotic connective tissue disease-associated ILD (CTD-ILD), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia at three US centres (test cohort) and one UK centre (validation cohort). 1-year change in FVC after satisfying proposed PF-ILD criteria was estimated using joint modelling. Subgroup analyses were performed to determine whether results varied across key subgroups.
RESULTS: 1227 patients were included, with CTD-ILD predominating. Six out of nine PF-ILD criteria were associated with differential 1-year change in FVC, with radiological progression of fibrosis, alone and in combination with other features, associated with the largest subsequent decline in FVC. Findings varied significantly by ILD subtype, with CTD-ILD demonstrating little change in FVC after satisfying most PF-ILD criteria, while other ILDs showed significantly larger changes. Findings did not vary after stratification by radiological pattern or exposure to immunosuppressant therapy. Near-term change in FVC after satisfying proposed PF-ILD criteria was heterogeneous depending on the criterion assessed and was strongly influenced by ILD subtype.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings may inform future clinical trial design and suggest ILD subtype should be taken into consideration when applying PF-ILD criteria.},

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with progressive fibrosing unclassifiable ILD.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 70 centres in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the UK. Eligible patients (aged ≥18-85 years) had progressive fibrosing unclassifiable ILD, a percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) of 45\% or higher and percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco) of 30\% or higher, more than 10\% fibrosis on high-resolution CT, and a high-resolution CT from the previous 12 months. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 2403 mg oral pirfenidone daily or placebo using a central validated interactive voice or web-based response system, stratified by concomitant mycophenolate mofetil use and presence or absence of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. Investigators, site personnel, and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was mean predicted change in FVC from baseline over 24 weeks, measured by daily home spirometry. Secondary endpoints were change in FVC measured by site spirometry, proportion of patients who had a more than 5\% or more than 10\% absolute or relative decline in percent predicted FVC measured by clinic-based spirometry, change in percent predicted DLco, change in 6-min walk distance (6MWD), change in University of California San Diego-Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ) score, change in Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, change in cough visual analogue scale, and changes in total and subscores of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), all of which were compared with baseline. Additional secondary endpoints included proportion of patients who had non-elective hospitalisation (respiratory and all-cause) and acute exacerbations, and progression-free survival. Efficacy was analysed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in the safety analysis set, which included all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03099187, and is no longer recruiting.
FINDINGS: Between May 15, 2017, and June 5, 2018, 253 patients were randomly assigned to receive 2403 mg pirfenidone (n=127) or placebo (n=126) and were included in the ITT analysis set. Analysis of the primary endpoint was affected by intraindividual variability in home spirometry values, which prevented application of the prespecified statistical model. Over 24 weeks, predicted median change in FVC measured by home spirometry was -87·7 mL (Q1-Q3 -338·1 to 148·6) in the pirfenidone group versus -157·1 mL (-370·9 to 70·1) in the placebo group. Over 24 weeks, predicted mean change in FVC measured by site spirometry was lower in patients given pirfenidone than placebo (treatment difference 95·3 mL [95\% CI 35·9 to 154·6], p=0·002). Compared with the placebo group, patients in the pirfenidone group were less likely to have a decline in FVC of more than 5\% (odds ratio [OR] 0·42 [95\% CI 0·25 to 0·69], p=0·001) or more than 10\% (OR 0·44 [0·23 to 0·84], p=0·011). At week 24, mean change in DLco from baseline was -0·7\% (SD 7·1) for the pirfenidone group and -2·5\% (8·8) for the placebo group, and mean change in 6MWD from baseline was -2·0 m (68·1) for the pirfenidone group and -26·7 m (79·3) for the placebo group. Changes from baseline in UCSD-SOBQ, Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, cough visual analogue scale, and SGRQ scores were similar between the pirfenidone and placebo groups at week 24. Analysis of acute exacerbations, hospital admissions, and time to death from respiratory causes during the study yielded no meaningful results due to a small number of events. No differences in progression-free survival were identified between the pirfenidone and placebo groups, irrespective of the definition of progression-free survival used. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 120 (94\%) of 127 patients in the pirfenidone group and 101 (81\%) of 124 patients in the placebo group. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 18 (14\%) patients in the pirfenidone group and 20 (16\%) patients in the placebo group. The most common treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders (60 [47\%] in the pirfenidone group vs 32 [26\%] in the placebo group), fatigue (16 [13\%] vs 12 [10\%]), and rash (13 [10\%] vs nine [7\%]).
INTERPRETATION: Although the planned statistical model could not be applied to the primary endpoint data, analysis of key secondary endpoints suggests that patients with progressive fibrosing unclassifiable ILD could benefit from pirfenidone treatment, which has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. These findings support further investigation of pirfenidone as an effective treatment for patients with progressive fibrotic unclassifiable ILD.

	abstract = {Background
Pirfenidone has been shown to slow disease progression in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, there are few treatment options for progressive fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (ILDs)) other than IPF. In view of the pathomechanistic and clinical similarities between IPF and other progressive fibrotic ILDs, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with four non-IPF progressive fibrotic ILDs.
Methods
We did a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel phase 2b trial (RELIEF) in 17 centres with expertise in ILD in Germany. Eligible participants were patients aged 18–80 years with progressive fibrotic ILD due to four diagnoses: collagen or vascular diseases (ie, connective tissue disease-associated ILDs), fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or asbestos-induced lung fibrosis. Other eligibility criteria included a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 40–90\% predicted, a diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide of 10–90\% predicted, and an annual decline of FVC of at least 5\% predicted despite conventional therapy, based on at least three measurements within 6–24 months before enrolment. Patients who had received any previous antifibrotic therapy were excluded. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either oral pirfenidone (267 mg three times per day in week 1, 534 mg three times per day in week 2, and 801 mg three times per day thereafter) or matched placebo, added to their ongoing medication. Randomisation was done centrally using permuted block randomisation with varying block sizes stratified by the four diagnostic groups. Patients, investigators, statisticians, monitors, and the study coordinator were masked to treatment assignment until database closure. The placebo-controlled study period was 48 weeks (including up-titration). The primary endpoint was absolute change in percentage of predicted FVC (FVC \% predicted) from baseline to week 48 in the intention-to-treat population, with imputation of missing data by the smallest sum of squared differences and attribution of deceased patients to the lowest rank in a rank ANCOVA model. Additionally, we did linear mixed-model repeated measures slope analyses of FVC \% predicted longitudinal data over the course of the study as a prespecified sensitivity analysis and post-hoc sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat population using imputation methods of last observation carried forward [LOCF] and a regression-based multiple imputation procedure. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with EudraCT 2014-000861-32; DRKS00009822 and is no longer recruiting.
Findings
Between April 5, 2016, and Oct 4, 2018, we randomly assigned 127 patients to treatment: 64 to pirfenidone, 63 to placebo. After 127 patients had been randomised, the study was prematurely terminated on the basis of an interim analysis for futility triggered by slow recruitment. After 48 weeks and in the overall population of 127 patients, rank ANCOVA with diagnostic group included as a factor showed a significantly lower decline in FVC \% predicted in the pirfenidone group compared with placebo (p=0·043); the result was similar when the model was stratified by diagnostic group (p=0·042). A significant treatment effect was also observed when applying the LOCF and multiple imputation methods to analyses of the primary endpoint. The median difference (Hodges-Lehmann estimate) between pirfenidone and placebo groups for the primary endpoint was 1·69 FVC \% predicted (95\% CI –0·65 to 4·03). In the linear mixed-model repeated measures slope analysis of FVC \% predicted, the estimated difference between treatment and placebo groups from baseline to week 48 was 3·53 FVC \% predicted (95\% CI 0·21 to 6·86) with imputation of deaths as prespecified, or 2·79 FVC \% predicted (95\% CI 0·03 to 5·54) without imputation. One death (non-respiratory) occurred in the pirfenidone group (2\%) and five deaths (three of which were respiratory) occurred in the placebo group (8\%). The most frequent serious adverse events in both groups were infections and infestations (five [8\%] in the pirfenidone group, ten [16\%] in the placebo group); general disorders including disease worsening (two [3\%] in the pirfenidone group, seven [11\%] in the placebo group); and cardiac disorders (one ([2\%] in the pirfenidone group, 5 [8\%] in the placebo group). Adverse events (grade 3–4) of nausea (two patients on pirfenidone, two on placebo), dyspnoea (one patient on pirfenidone, one on placebo), and diarrhoea (one patient on pirfenidone) were also observed.
Interpretation
In view of the premature study termination, results should be interpreted with care. Nevertheless, our data suggest that in patients with fibrotic ILDs other than IPF who deteriorate despite conventional therapy, adding pirfenidone to existing treatment might attenuate disease progression as measured by decline in FVC.

	abstract = {Introduction Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal disease of unknown cause characterised by progressive fibrotic formation in lung tissue. We hypothesise that disrupted metabolic pathways in IPF contribute to disease pathogenesis.
Methods Metabolomics of human IPF was performed using mass spectroscopy (IPF lung=8; donor lung=8). Gene expression of key metabolic enzymes was measured using microarrays. Of the 108 metabolites whose levels were found altered, 48 were significantly increased, whereas 60 were significantly decreased in IPF samples compared with normal controls.
Results Specific metabolic pathways mediating the IPF remodelling were found with a downregulated sphingolipid metabolic pathway but an upregulated arginine pathway in IPF. In addition, disrupted glycolysis, mitochondrial beta-oxidation and tricarboxylic acid cycle, altered bile acid, haem and glutamate/aspartate metabolism were found in IPF samples compared with control.
Conclusions Our results show alterations in metabolic pathways for energy consumption during lung structural remodelling, which may contribute to IPF pathogenesis. We believe that this is the first report of simultaneously and systemically measuring changes of metabolites involving nine metabolic pathways in human severe IPF lungs. The measurement of the metabolites may serve in the future diagnosis and prognosis of IPF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are characterized by shared exposures and clinical features, but distinct genetic and pathologic features exist. These features have not been well-studied using large-scale gene expression datasets. We hypothesized that there are divergent gene, pathway, and cellular signatures between COPD and IPF.
METHODS: We performed RNA-sequencing on lung tissues from individuals with IPF (n = 231) and COPD (n = 377) compared to control (n = 267), defined as individuals with normal spirometry. We grouped the overlapping differential expression gene sets based on direction of expression and examined the resultant sets for genes of interest, pathway enrichment, and cell composition. Using gene set variation analysis, we validated the overlap group gene sets in independent COPD and IPF data sets.
RESULTS: We found 5010 genes differentially expressed between COPD and control, and 11,454 genes differentially expressed between IPF and control (1\% false discovery rate). 3846 genes overlapped between IPF and COPD. Several pathways were enriched for genes upregulated in COPD and downregulated in IPF; however, no pathways were enriched for genes downregulated in COPD and upregulated in IPF. There were many myeloid cell genes with increased expression in COPD but decreased in IPF. We found that the genes upregulated in COPD but downregulated in IPF were associated with lower lung function in the independent validation cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a divergent gene expression signature between COPD and IPF, with increased expression in COPD and decreased in IPF. This signature is associated with worse lung function in both COPD and IPF.},

	abstract = {Objectives
 As an epigenetic player, long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been reported to participate in multiple biological processes; however, their biological functions in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis (SIPF) occurrence and development remain incompletely understood.

 Methods
 Five case/control pairs were used to perform integrated transcriptomes analysis of lncRNA and mRNA. Prediction of lncRNA and mRNA functions was aided by the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Additionally, we constructed a coexpression network of lncRNAs and mRNAs to identify targets of regulation.

 Results
 In total, 1069 differentially expressed mRNAs and 366 lncRNAs were identified with the changes more than 2 times (p{\textless}0.05), of which 351 downregulated mRNA and 31 downregulated lncRNA were {\textless}0.5 (p{\textless}0.05) and those of 718 upregulated mRNAs and 335 upregulated lncRNA were {\textgreater}2 (p{\textless}0.05). The levels of 10 lncRNAs were measured via qRT-PCR; the results were consistent with the microarray data. Four genes named of FEM1B, TRIM39, TRIM32, and KLHL15 were enriched significantly with ubiquitination and immune response. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction was the most significantly enriched KEGG pathway in both mRNAs and lncRNAs. The coexpression network revealed that a single lncRNA can interact with multiple mRNAs, and vice versa.

 Conclusions
 lncRNA and mRNA expression were aberrant in patients with SIPF compared to controls, indicating that differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs may play critical roles in SIPF development. Our study affords new insights into the molecular mechanisms of SIPF and identifies potential biomarkers and targets for SIPF diagnosis and treatment.},

	abstract = {Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is a histological pattern characteristic of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The UIP pattern is patchy with histologically normal lung adjacent to dense fibrotic tissue. At this interface, fibroblastic foci (FF) are present and are sites where myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulate. Utilizing laser capture microdissection-coupled mass spectrometry, we interrogated the FF, adjacent mature scar, and adjacent alveoli in 6 fibrotic (UIP/IPF) specimens plus 6 nonfibrotic alveolar specimens as controls. The data were subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis and histologically validated. We found that the fibrotic alveoli protein signature is defined by immune deregulation as the strongest category. The fibrotic mature scar classified as end-stage fibrosis whereas the FF contained an overabundance of a distinctive ECM compared with the nonfibrotic control. Furthermore, FF were positive for both TGFB1 and TGFB3, whereas the aberrant basaloid cell lining of FF was predominantly positive for TGFB2. In conclusion, spatial proteomics demonstrated distinct protein compositions in the histologically defined regions of UIP/IPF tissue. These data revealed that FF are the main site of collagen biosynthesis and that the adjacent alveoli are abnormal. This essential information will inform future mechanistic studies on fibrosis progression.},
